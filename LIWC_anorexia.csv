R123456710,"First of all, you're not ugly at ALL. The pic with you in the suit is very flattering. I would say the first and last pics make your face look a bit wider at the bottom, it may just be the angle, try taking selfies from a point higher up and farther away. In the second pic, your smile is beautiful. I think all you need is a bit more confidence and you'll have girls flocking towards you no problem. To be honest, I'm not gonna say I don't know what you're talking about when you mentioned the anorexia analogy. For a large part of my life, I've always been super insecure about my appearance, to the point where I hated people looking at me. I remember sitting in business class one day wishing I had a paper bag I could put over my face just so people wouldn't be offended by my looks. It wasn't till this year that my biology teacher recommended I see a social worker and counsellor due to my self esteem issues (I had an emotional break down right in front of him). But anyways, the point of my little anecdote is that despite my super low self esteem and my personal view of myself, people don't actually see me the way I see myself. I even made a post here to ask strangers what they think of me (you can check it out if you want), and to my surprise people actually said I'm pretty. So chin up, you're not as bad as you think. It may be hypocritical of me to say this, but you shouldn't over analyze yourself so much. Next time you look in the mirror, look at the attractive man you are, not the ugly man your mind thinks you are. Overall, I'd give you a 7-7.5/10. With a nice smile and better camera angle, maybe a little stubble, I would give you an 8-8.5/10.

nirachi," It's not unusual for a person on an extreme diet or exercise program to have a compromised immune system. The lifestyle changes utilized to facilitate such a large amount of weight loss are not always healthy, even if the end results are aesthetically pleasing. It's hard to say if that is applicable in this case, however. As a physician, you could find out if this is the cause by looking for biomarkers associated with anorexia, which is actually very similar to the biomarkers of a bodybuilder during a competition.

That i controlled nothing in my life, so my brain defaulted to the one thing it had control of, my weight. Anorexia exists in every country, in every time frame, even those who idolize a more plump figure. this is not about weight, as you said, it is about control and perfection and being able to take one thing that you can take, when you feel like nothing is left.

gymrat_kitty,"The thing that bothers me is that, among mainstream fatty types, it's actually acceptable to subtly bash on people with ED's, with comments like ""skinny bitches"" and ""i want to be thin--but not a gross twig"" with this tone of voice that people with EDs are somehow vain/conceited/unlikeable/judgmental or something. Yes, emaciation IS unhealthy and gross, but so are other things: imagine the comments people make about anorexic people, and then imagine someone saying the same things about a burn victim or someone with a learning disability. ED is a mental disorder. I have never had ED, but I get angry on behalf of those who do. It's like fatties are so defensive that, instead of recognizing anorexia as an anxiety involving feelings of no control (from past abuse, or insane controlling parents or something), they act like an anorexic girl is a direct attack on their fatness.

When they're hospitalized they're grouped with the old people as fall risks and they have to be fed through a tube, because if you feed them too much to fast their stomach will literally explode. It's a devastating illness that leaves sufferers with lasting consequences. And hams will completely disregard their struggle because they're skinny. I hate how these fat fucks giggle and smile about being fat while my friend from high school was already under 100 lbs when she developed an eating disorder and she couldn't stand looking in the mirror despite having a great body.

Both are bad, yes, but obesity is more easier to treat 99 times out of 100. IMO.

Quietuus,"I've done a fairly large amount of research on the issue myself, but I come to it from a more political and social issues stance. There are enough dissenting voices, ill-fitting data and deficiencies in studies for me to have serious doubts about both the prevalance and effects of obesity, particularly when we talk about people at the lower end of what is now considered obese (a definition category which has expanded quite dizzily over the last 20-30 years). I also seriously worry that particularly for a lot of people in this lower band (or those trying to avoid it) the mental and physical toll wrought by body image issues and haphazard attempts to control weight is going to do more damage than weight. One factor that we know exacerbates almost every other health condition and shortens the human life span is stress. Anywhere from 10-20 million plus Americans (depending on which figures you look at) suffer from eating disorders, a number which is growing. The long term and short term health effects of anorexia nervosa particularly are extremely serious; much worse than being somewhat overweight. I mean, it kills 15-20% of the people who have it according to long-range studies. Bulimia and other eating disorders are nice only by comparison. I also worry to what extent our cultural dialogues against fat produce medical harm; I'm sure if you've researched the issue you'll probably have come across the papers about how people who are considered overweight tend to access medical care less, how they are overdiagnosed or underdiagnosed certain conditions, how they are given the wrong doses for medication, refused treatment (and in the US refused health insurance) more often (often for little good clinical reason) and so on. I believe that these are inevitable consequences of treating obesity as an epidemic disease; as is the exaggerated fear of contagion you often see in reddit fat-haters, who seem to fear that those who would try and live with fat (particularly) are some sort of diabolical social cancer. Fat isn't contagious, it's not an illness to be fought with the efficiency of a military campaign; it's a very visible (and somewhat erratic) single indicator of health, diet and so on. The decision to treat it as an epidemic, to highlight its dangers, to focus on *this* problem specifically over so many others (particularly less visible problems like mental health generally) seems to me to be obviously a political matter. The treatment of fat people as sufferers from an epidemic disease tends to enable their dehumanisation, both in terms of the medical profession and ultimately in terms of subs like /r/fatpeoplehate.",Negareddit,t5_2vsbl,2,446.0,75.17,61.48,22.0,1.0,34.31,24.22,88.57,50.0,11.21,4.71,2.24,0.9,0.9,0.0,0.67,6.5,6.5,15.7,6.73,7.62,7.17,0.45,12.56,7.85,3.59,2.91,2.02,3.59,6.95,1.35,5.61,1.57,0.67,0.9,6.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.25,3.14,2.69,1.12,5.16,2.69,2.69,1.79,1.12,0.22,0.45,9.64,1.35,8.52,0.0,3.81,7.62,1.35,0.9,2.69,0.67,2.02,0.9,10.09,0.45,9.42,0.9,6.28,2.24,2.02,0.45,0.0,0.22,0.0,0.9,0.67,0.0,0.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.57,2.91,3.14,0.0,0.9,0.0,0.0,1.35,0.0,1.57,3.59,1.12

_____1_____2_____3,"Lowest BMI was 15. I'm naturally on the curvy side, between hourglass and pear. When my eating disorder first began to manifest, I was restricting a bit, then purging once or twice a day which caused me to become depressed. My mom noticed something was wrong and read my journal (I had just turned 12 at that point). I convinced her that I was totally fine and it was just a phase. She thought I was too young to have an eating disorder. She offered to take me to counseling but I said no. I got better at hiding it. When the school year started, I turned to serious restricting and exercising. I lost a lot of weight very quickly, was freezing and exhausted all the time, and my hair was falling out in clumps. I was wearing a lot of extra layers of clothes, both to keep warm and to hide my figure. My mom didn't realize how much weight I had lost until I passed out in the shower and she found me. Thus began me getting help: she took me to my pediatrician, who sent me to the state eating disorder specialist. I was diagnosed with anorexia and then hospitalized for the first time for dramatic weight loss, malnutrition, and heart problems. So basically I was forced to get help for years because I was a minor. It wasn't until I was 19 that I decided to take things seriously and pull myself out of the rut.",casualiama,t5_2sxwp,3,250.0,41.25,15.86,94.87,2.02,15.62,16.8,90.8,56.0,18.8,14.8,12.8,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,5.6,12.4,8.0,4.8,8.8,1.2,19.2,3.2,0.8,2.0,2.8,2.8,5.2,1.2,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.6,0.8,0.0,2.8,0.0,9.6,3.6,2.0,0.4,1.6,0.8,1.6,2.4,0.0,0.4,2.0,6.0,1.2,2.4,0.0,2.8,8.4,0.8,2.4,2.0,2.8,2.0,12.8,3.2,0.8,15.2,2.8,4.8,8.0,1.2,0.8,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.8,6.4,4.0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2,0.8,0.0

skyscraperblue,"I'm a college student in her third year of a Mathematics degree. I started running when I was 15 purely because it was fun and sounded like a cool thing to do. Turns out making that decision saved my life. Running pulled me all the way through severe clinical depression and anorexia - some days the only thing that could get me out of bed was a run, and running teaches you about fueling fairly freaking fast, i.e. you will pass out midway through if you don't eat. Running better was the only thing I could promise myself to make myself eat for a long time during recovery. These days running keeps my sanity in check and my brain away from the dark corners, and finds new ways every day to teach me that fueling my body properly *really matters*. And then I was told lifting would help improve my running form and tried it and was hooked.

QuietSci,"Oh man. I could write an entire book on this chick. For somplicity we'll call her ""H."" H is my fiancees best friend since they were kids, but she has a bad home life, so when my fiancee and I decide to get a place with a spare bedroom we ask if she wants to room with us, we even offer to drive to the other sode of the state, pay for a u-hual truck, and drive back with her, on top of offering to loan her her first 2 months of rent so she would have time to get a job. Turns out she is completely, crazily narssisicstic, when she does get a job, every fucking cent goes to expensive perfumes and makeups and facial medications. She had 'medical emergencies' where she would make up some vauge symptoms and get my fiancee to get off of work to drive her to the ER, where they would promptly tell her that the only thing wrog with her was that she refused to eat anything other than iced coffee and mashed/liquid food (which I will give her, may have actually been a manifestation of anorexia.) She would never do her dishes, and when she finally moved out I found rotten food in her room from at least 4 weeks before. She constantly screamed and threw things at us if she didn't get her way. She would interrupt other people's conversations (mid sentence) because they ""weren't interesting to her""  YOU WEREN'T EVEN IN THE FUCKING ROOM, YOU WERE NOT PART OF THIS CONVERSATION! She would eavesdrop on us, I even caught her once sitting at the door to our room just standing there listening to our conversations. Her excuse? ""Had to make sure you weren't talking about me behind my back.""

Yqueserasarah,"Hi there. I have been in a similar place and want to tell you how much hope there is yet, and strength to gain from this. I had anorexia, then bulimia, then progressed into b.e.d. and now find myself having made a friend out of food, my body, and, most importantly, my mind. I healed myself through reading, writing, and the momentum gained through that positive focus. It was not easy. Constant redirection was required. Cognitive behavioral therapy was a fantastic tool. I countered negative thoughts with positive world actions. You sound like you are focused on moving forward. You are gaining a foundation of self that no external force can shake.  Look inside for your strength and find positive places to funnel that focus. PM anytime.

Rofldaf1,"Why is it not as simple as ""just eat""? From my perception of the disorder, eating would cure the issues that result from the disorder. If you're not hungry, that is a real shame, but if you abstain from food when you are so skinny that you can see the bones in your face and ribs, I have no sympathy for you. You can still eat, just because you're don't want to. Everybody knows food is vital for survival. You should eat even though you are not hungry. Just measure the calories you intake and make sure it is around 2000. If you notice weight loss, increase your calorie intake. Yes it's a shame that people with anorexia have a reduced appetite, but if you stop eating because of that despite knowing it is vital, you don't get my sympathy. I myself have gone through stressful times where I have anorexia and have abstained from eating, but I knew at the time that if I ever started losing weight I would force myself to eat, because I must.

Our rule was we would only allow each other to take shit from each other. If someone else tried to mess with me or him we would both put a stop to it. Also, I dated a girl who struggled with Anorexia. We went almost a year with no contact. She needed my help one day, and when I got to her she looked rail thin. Maybe it was the tight clothing she was wearing, but she looked like she was back to not eating. I addressed my concern and she said there was nothing to be worried about, but she did enjoy hearing that the extra activity was showing. Her sister came in and told me that she was being eaten out of house and home.

snallygaster,"Pure fat acceptance isn't the answer, but outright shame/bullying isn't either. If it were only a matter of fat being unhealthy, shame might be the answer, just as it has curtailed smoking addiction and drunk driving, but fat is also considered ugly, so calling somebody a 'fat fuck', 'piggy', etc. is essentially calling them ugly as well. Which, of course, can lead to insecurity and mental health issues, since being called ugly is a very crippling insult to many people.  This can cause problems in the form of anorexia, bulimia, or even more binge eating, since food is a great comfort/diversion. Of course, fat acceptance is also pretty awful given that the movement enables unhealthy eating habits and gives fodder for people to rationalize away their fatness. I think that encouragement and reward for healthy habits and (healthy) weight loss are the best way to tackle the problem, along with widespread education about how to eat healthily and the consequences of obesity (and the positive consequences of fitness!).

grumpyfat," There has been historical documentation of cases of anorexia and bulimia dating back hundreds (even thousands, I believe, but need to find my source before I say for sure) of years, long before there was any overwhelming cultural emphasis on beauty and thinness. It is estimated that only 2-5% of the U.S. population suffers from restrictive type eating disorders, and that it is a generous figure. I don't know this for sure, but I would imagine that those numbers don't differ too dramatically in populations of societies that don't subscribe to western ideals of beauty. I think that certainly our obsession with appearance contributes to, and can even be the main instigator of disordered eating habits, but not actual eating disorders.

VixenVexen,"I'm very sorry to hear about this :/ I have two siblings with Autism, they are high functioning and from them I have learned more about Autism and Aspergers. And I agree for sure, the fact that your mother took her to a gym and told her Bulimia is cheating is a red flag. They should have sat her down and spoken to her about this and trying to figure out what caused it and how to help. If you want to educate your mother on this situation I would start by telling her the way she handled it is in no way right, it just makes it seem like she is encouraging it rather then anything, And then tell her the dangers of anorexia and bulimia. If your mother cannot understand your sister's disability, I would try and educate her on it as much as possible with all the articles and magazines you can find on this topic. And just reach out to your sister, just talk to her. Invite her to lunch or a movie, and be the support she needs through this.

bluedinosaur221,"I understand what you're saying, but it doesn't seem like her parents were (any longer) blocking her access to support online. She clearly had pretty unfettered online access given her Tumblr. And for whatever reason, whether she saw these posts and reblogs or not, she didn't reach out directly. But she was clearly asking for someone to help her. I don't use Tumblr or Instagram and I've only recently become aware that there is an intricate network of suicide, self-harm, anorexia, etc. blogs and that they are in contact with one another, they like each other's posts, they're reblogging, and they use certain hashtags. So I guess I'm saying maybe these outreach organizations and helplines need to become more aware of that and try to engage before the person on the other end reaches out themselves. Because maybe it doesn't always start with someone saying, ""I'm suicidal, help me"", maybe sometimes it starts with the help saying, ""I can see you're suicidal, how can I help you?""",LGBTnews,t5_2r99w,0,168.0,9.71,79.76,23.51,70.57,21.0,20.24,89.88,57.14,22.62,14.29,5.36,0.0,1.79,4.76,2.38,8.33,2.38,10.12,11.31,5.36,8.93,2.98,21.43,2.38,2.98,2.38,0.6,2.38,3.57,2.98,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.64,0.6,0.6,4.76,0.0,20.83,4.17,2.98,0.6,7.74,2.98,4.76,3.57,1.19,2.38,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.6,5.36,3.57,0.6,2.38,1.19,0.0,3.57,16.07,0.0,7.74,0.0,3.57,4.17,0.6,2.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.79,1.19,0.0,1.19,0.0,0.0,0.0,23.81,4.17,8.33,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.6,2.38,6.55,1.19,0.0

squeezylemon,"Opposite end of the scale - literally - but when my sister was in treatment for anorexia, both her therapist and her doctor were firmly on the side of bribes. ""It's not a bribe if it works,"" was the logic. It helped her to focus on something other than calories and her weight all the time. The issues are different for people losing weight, obviously, but counting and tracking calories can be exhausting and the slow progress of truly sustainable weight loss can be demoralizing. If scheduling a pick-me-up helps you stay on track, then go for it...especially if the rewards are not food-related.

yungxpotato,I disagree that anorexia is the flip side of being fat. Anorexics have a lot of fear and intense anxiety surrounding food and eating that fat people don't have (to the same extent) about not eating.

sarahthesnowgirl,"When I was 13, I was weighed at the doctors office in front of my dad.  I was wearing doc Martins at the time and they  probably added 6ish lbs.  I was actually underweight,  but he made a comment about how I was ""porking up"".  And for the next ten years,  I dealt with both anorexia and bulimia. He refused to believe for years that my eating disorder and depression were in any way related to him.  Then,  after a suicide attempt at 21,  being 5'4 and weighing in at a whopping 89 lbs, I got him (with a lot of help from my mom) to come to therapy with me,  where my therapist refused to let him sit there blameless.  It finally hit home for him,  that  some of my issues stemmed from how he treated me.  I wish I could say that he did a complete 180 (he didn't), but at least I gave it my all and he has to live with knowing how his careless words over the years,  shaped my life.  I can happily say that I am at a very healthy weight now and happily gained 40lbs during my pregnancy.  I got lucky and got to talk to an amazing therapist and had tons of support from my mom and friends and family.  Remind her everyday that she is beautiful.  Make her tell herself 3 positive things about herself everyday (they have to be different everyday). Put positive notes about her on her mirror,  where she'll see them,  when she sees herself.  And be ready to support her and be prepared for backsides.  If/when they happen, remind her of why she needs to eat and keep it down and that she is stronger than any eating disorder. Sorry about the long post. Best of luck to you both with everything.  Sending positive vibes your way.

cardamomlace2,"If she's in and out for treatment for anorexia all the time, I would be really worried about it rubbing off on your kid. Your daughter is a preteen now, but she's pretty much on the cusp of getting to that age where girls start becoming very self conscious of their bodies and your wife is in a very bad place to be an actual parent for her. Even if she is careful to not enforce negative attitudes (I.e, she is carefully to not use body shaming language, etc), her own habits, like not eating or obsessive calorie counting, are gonna rub off on your daughter and signal to her that having unhealthily obsessive habits like your wife might be normal or desirable. That isn't to say that women who have been anorexic in the past are unfit parents, but your wife is in and out of the hospital all the time, and she seems like she can barely deal with herself, much less a kid. I feel like your wife absolutely needs to be in counseling or working on getting her anorexia in control before you can even begin to consider her to be a fully there parent, especially with the drug abuse. If you fight for custody (which you should), could you hire a nanny or lean on family members to look after your kid if you're away?

But as an anorexia surviver, seeing stuff like ""eat a sandwich"" ""damn I just want to feed her"" is all detrimental to anyone with similar body image/food issues. Telling someone with an eating disorder to ""just eat"" is the same as telling someone with depression to ""just smile"". It's not that simple. It's a complex issue that has festered over time, just like any other mental issue.

valentinaolsen,"I might be so far down in the comments you may not see this, but I think you are doing the right thing. At around 10 yes old my dad started saying I ate too much and I was built like a man (if you look in my submitted picture history [NSFW!!!] you will see I'm actually very much built like a woman and very tiny). By age 11, I began cutting myself whenever he called me a man, and by age 13, I was full-blown anorexic. And if I was forced to eat anything, I would throw it up. This lasted until I was 22 and 5'6 and 89 lbs. and I was so skinny. My dad never realized he was the problem. A few of my friends knew and finally my boyfriend at the time said you are getting help whether I have to baker act you or not (for cutting, I don't think he could baker act me for the anorexia). So I started trying to eat again to get to 110 lbs. and started seeing a therapist about my cutting and it was hard and I cried when I looked at myself as I was gaining the weight back, because I saw myself as a huge obese man, even though of course I didn't look like that at all. I am now 24 and still struggle with the urge to cut and not to start skipping meals when I feel I look a bit hefty (5'6 and 117 lbs now, still underweight but decent). What your husband said can have long term effects on her even if you try your best to tell her she's beautiful. Not saying she may be cutting (that's a rare thing to do and I'm not even sure what prompted me to start) but she will always live with what he said. Your positive words don't always make up for his mean ones. All I can say is keep her in therapy as long as she feels she needs it and don't let her get to the point I did. I could have died at my lowest weight and that didn't matter to me, all that mattered was that I didn't look like I built like a man. Everyone always told me what a dainty little girl I was, just my dads words always were in the back of my head. Those words never go away and it will be a tough struggle to get out of if she has gotten to far into an anorexia mindset. Let her know they have given me permanent heart and thyroid problems because of my foolishness, as they do many others who are anorexic. She seems like a smart girl, I pray for the best for her health and your family to recover from this. I feel like if my mom had stopped my dad from calling me a man all the time none of my problems would've ever started so you are doing the right thing nipping it in the bud.

I couldn't understand why they just didn't do that. They wouldn't have to devote any time to it really, just cut down on calorie intake. Even exercising is optional.

Think of it this way: if you had a community of people who thought being transgendered was just fine, got transgendered people everything they needed to realize their transitions, and otherwise supported them 100% in their goal, no one would be harmed. If you had a community of people who were 100% devoted to helping anorexics achieve their goals of being as thin as they want to be, a lot of people would end up dead. Anorexia without treatment has grievous, often permanent or fatal effects on the body due to lack of nutrients.

6383,"5'5 and 116 lbs here, so slender but nothing unusual, and my legs look quite a bit like the ones in the picture, and standing with my legs together, there's a pretty noticeable 3-inch gap between my thighs. Conversely, my sister, who's a good 25 lbs underweight and has been genuinely diagnosed with anorexia nervosa doesn't have a thigh gap. If you have wide, angled hips and are relatively slim, you'll probably have a thigh gap regardless of whether or not you have an ED, and likewise, some people weren't built to ever have one. Ironic that organizations that proclaim to be body-positive are willing to ban certain models for their build, especially on the basis of a physical phenomena that really isn't exclusive to people who are underweight, and I strongly doubt that they would ever object to a model without a thigh gap on the grounds that it might promote obesity.

maybesaydie,"Heroin chic is a terrible example. That kind of fashion model was seen in Vogue Magazine and in the very limited (as far as public exposure goes)  couture industry.. Very few average white people went after that look. That was media circus, not a trend and I cannot think of one person who bought into it.Fashion magazines are pretty toys for looking at but very few women actually emulate what they see there. Do you have one example in real life of someone becoming a heroin addict because of a fashion shoot? Anorexia isn't the result of reading too many fashion magazines. It's a complex mental health condition, as are all eating disorders and you do a disservice to those who suffer from them by intimating that it's caused by the media.

dolostone7," There were all sort of contributing factors, the most important one is genetic.  I hope I didn't give the impression that one toy single handedly drove me to that dark place, I just didn't think anyone wanted to sit through the whole story of how things progressed so I skipped ahead.  As I already mentioned, an essential factor is genetics.  (Only a certain percentage of youngsters have the gene for anorexia sitting dormant, waiting to be triggered)  The Barbie experience was my first trigger that set of the body dismorphia.  From that point forward, I looked in the mirror and saw myself maybe twenty pounds heavier, with a special distaste for my thighs. Every time I looked at someone else I would compare their size to mine, especially if they were smaller.    It's weird to look bad at the pictures now and see how different I actually looked like to what I thought at the time.  My mother didn't help. Sometimes she'd comment that my sister and I were much bigger than she was as a kid, or tell me I shouldn't be eating that.  That was a terrible thing to say to kid who already wouldn't go into a pool without wearing shorts to cover her thighs, and I vow I will NEVER make those sort of mistakes if I ever have children of my own.   The dam broke when my best friend in high school would say things that would especially trigger that fear of food, which is when I first acted out against the ""obese"" person I saw in the mirror and fought the enemy (food).  So yes, the whole thing wasn't because of one doll, Barbie was just my first memory of a snowball process that went out of control.   I don't like to think about that part of my life anymore, because it is filled with regret.  But I do feel responsible for sharing my story in the hopes that people understand how serious triggers can be for an unfortunate percent of us.  But my story does have a happy ending: a little while after the salad incident I brought myself to a therapist's office in tears, and got the help I needed. I now have a good control of my triggers, am incredibly body positive, and spend every day so happy that I'm still around to enjoy it.    I really appreciate that you are interested in my story, hope this helps clear things up.",Showerthoughts,t5_2szyo,1,410.0,45.86,24.72,70.01,53.27,24.12,17.56,93.41,57.56,19.02,11.71,10.0,0.24,0.24,0.73,0.49,7.32,7.07,13.66,9.02,6.34,6.1,2.2,17.8,5.37,2.93,1.95,1.95,2.68,7.32,4.39,2.93,0.24,0.49,0.73,8.78,0.49,0.24,1.22,0.0,16.34,1.71,3.41,3.41,3.17,2.68,3.9,3.66,2.44,0.49,0.49,3.17,1.22,0.98,0.0,1.46,6.34,1.71,1.22,3.17,0.98,0.24,6.34,9.51,0.98,12.68,1.22,5.85,6.1,0.98,0.49,0.24,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,12.93,4.15,4.15,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,2.93,0.98,0.0

PrincessCheese,"I could not agree more. The past 2 years my depression got really bad, and subsequently I put on about 20 lbs. I used to be a very thin, national level athlete, an A+ student, everything going my way, until a complete mental breakdown my senior year of high school ruined everything. Starting college put me in an even deeper hole because before the ""storm"", I had accepted an athletic scholarship at a D1 school, and the pressure of performing and looking like a proper athlete caused further self destruction. But instead of causing an eating disorder like anorexia, I went down the opposite path and kinda gave up on myself. I can't even compete anymore. There are so many days where food seems like the only thing that will bring me an ounce of joy, but immediately after eating that bag of chips, I'm crying of regret and wanting to kill myself. But its a vicious cycle and I don't know how to break it.

hopelessneurotic,"At first, I hated every moment of it. I did it because I had to, but every moment of it I was planning my relapse. The whole recovery process was just a temporary measure to appease the doctors and family members pleading for me to make a change. I'd like to say that the symptoms of starvation (purple fingernails, constant feeling of cold, thoughts entirely dominated by food, fainting spells) went away with the beginning of refeed, but they really just got worse. Food made me bloated and hurt my stomach like hell. I was constantly nauseated, and felt disgusted with myself all of the time. But soon, my body began to react. After months of starvation, I suddenly felt a huge urge to eat. And eat. And eat. I was hungry constantly, and the hunger was completely consuming. Relapse was now impossible, my body needed to EAT. Emotionally, this was awful. I felt like I was binging, and that I was just going to gain weight infinitely. But as I continued through the recovery process, I started noticing other changes. My brain began to process things at a normal pace, I was less depressed. I actually wanted to go out and see people and do things. I had energy and enthusiasm for life. I still to this day get the occasional extreme hunger, but this has really gone down with a regular meal plan. Certain foods (my ""fear foods"") and situations (eating around family members and friends) still give me anxiety, but through therapy and support groups I'm learning coping mechanisms to overcome those feelings. Really, I just feel better. So much better.

Technically you would have EDNOS but that regroups so many eating disorders with a certain weight criteria, not just anorexia. As a person who was anorexic without being underweight (i had a normal weight), i wasn't diagnosed with EDNOS. I was told i was borderline anorexic. You have no idea if that person was diagnosed or not. You say she's obese which you don't know for a fact, she says she didn't ""look anorexic"" not fat. If I had a penny for everytime an anorexic girl said she doesn't ""look anorexic"", I would be a billionnaire. They are all in denial about their appearance. People only really notice if they closely monitor their eating habits or if they are severely underweight. All in all don't just claim people want the anorexic label, some if them do but the truth is you have no facts.

Once you can do that, try eating with the person you feel safest with somewhere out in public. Then increase that to your two closest friends. And so on until you feel comfortable in the group.
