Pablo_Hassan,"Cool, I have read the article,  it doesn't say it's myth though (is it in the reference material?) .  It merely suggests that is not as easy as restrict cals get thin..  But go to places where the cals don't exist and then the obesity you will not find,  which eludes to,  if the calories are not available then you just don't have anything to get fat on. Diets or Lifestyle choices like 'body for life'  or 'Wahls Protocol'  or even '5/2 diet' all work,  and are all based on reducing your incoming calories,  changing the incoming carbs to complex and increasing your calories out -  I have tried all 3 and all 3 work,  of course you have to stay on track and keep on the low in high out road,  which is why things fail,  I am really seduced by the bacon flavoured croissant side.  What I find interesting is that diets are like an exposure triangle,  cut one of the 3 out,  ie,  carb fat or protien and you lose weight.

Hobosock,"My ambulance company transfers a guy to dialysis who is massive. He insists that he's about 475 but I guarantee he's scaring the hell out of 700lbs.  He has to be moved, cleaned, and fed by other people.  They added another room to his house because he can no longer fit, so now his whole life is in that room, the back of a bariatric ambulance, and a dialysis clinic.  He is in absolute denial about his size, and refuses to do physical therapy to try and drop his weight. The floor under his bed is giving out, and he's either going to have a heart attack or fall through that floor and suffocate because he can't move to clear his airway.  This is an extreme example, but with obesity comes high blood pressure, heart problems, diabetes, stress on the joints, and all kinds of problems.

DeathSpank1995,"A lot of Saudis called us anti christ followers and that our whole country is destined to go to hell( even though we were already destined to hell because we allow women to drive) because we have shared gyms and that our government and general public encourage females and males to go the gym. the main reason i feel we have obesity with older people in Arab countries is the recent introduction of processed foods and many fast food chains. So rather than adapting to the new variety of food, they are just used to eating whatever and whenever and not gaining weight. but with processed food and fast food chains you cant really do that, you need to watch what you eat. Another thing is since a lot of the food is newly introduced in the past 10 years, the general awareness of how bad the food is and what it can do to is not there, yes people know fast food isn't as healthy as other food, but they don't know the actual affects of the food. This is the reasoning i can come up with my country Oman(neighbor country to saudi arabia). but reading the article i see in Saudi its really that women aren't allowed to do anything besides stay in their homes.

burtzev,Thanks for the reference. It stands to reason that a disease like diabetes where obesity is a major risk factor would increase with the increase in obesity. I also think that there is a fairly well documented increase in asthma. Where I grew up it was basically unknown. Nowadays it's endemic. This relates back to the 'hygiene hypothesis' . I was interested in the remarks about the historical changes in the microbiome. That is something that hasn't been looked at in any great detail.

Public knowledge and education of energetic contents of foods and what one can/should consume in what quantities becomes increasingly more relevant especially because of the rapid increase in obesity, and having any kind of measure to orient after for the average person without having to intricately understand complications in food physiology, digestion and metabolism (that affect our methods of measurement for energetic content) is still helpful. In other words, ""if you want to lose weight don't consume more energy than your body expends"" is simple enough for people to get and enables people to make a numbers game out of calories (that admittedly may or may not be inprecise to a certain degree), and effective enough that the mechanisms and backgrounds that make the statement unreasonable are negligible for most people (but of course important to consider in a scientific context).",askscience,t5_2qm4e,1,146.0,84.71,50.0,22.36,92.0,48.67,32.19,82.19,50.0,7.53,2.05,0.0,0.68,1.37,0.0,0.0,5.48,4.79,18.49,8.9,2.05,8.22,2.74,13.7,8.22,4.79,1.37,0.68,3.42,5.48,4.79,0.68,0.0,0.0,0.68,6.85,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21.23,4.79,4.11,2.05,4.79,2.05,6.16,0.68,0.0,0.0,0.68,4.11,0.68,1.37,0.0,3.42,6.16,2.05,2.05,1.37,1.37,0.68,0.0,10.27,1.37,7.53,2.05,4.11,1.37,2.05,0.68,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.33,2.05,2.74,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.37,1.37,4.11,0.68

Your hips, thighs, and breasts are all developing more to the scale of an adult woman. 40-50 pounds does sounds excessive for two years time, but I wouldn't worry to much about the number on the scale. Focus on living a healthy and active life. Be concious of what you are putting into your body and make healthy decisions, and find an excercise routine, that you enjoy, that works for you.

evilricksanchez,On yeah man. Obesity related illness is the number one cause of death in the states. Probably the world. Being obese is way more unhealthy than smoking and smoking is unhealthy as fuck so that's saying something. Man other difference is we smokers aren't delusional. I'm fully aware that smoking is harmful and don't make excuses to the contrary. Fatties on the other hand seem dead set convinced that their weight is in no way detrimental to their health.

I get skinnier when I'm not working out so obesity isn't my problem. My doc says guys that are slightly overweight outlast those that are underweight. I'm now 40. My oldest is now 9. I'm at a healthy weight and I run 3 to 5 miles regularly at an 8 minute per mile pace. ,daddit,t5_2rxue,3,82.0,29.48,4.41,99.0,25.77,11.71,15.85,84.15,52.44,18.29,14.63,14.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.66,4.88,10.98,10.98,7.32,4.88,2.44,20.73,7.32,4.88,1.22,8.54,0.0,2.44,1.22,1.22,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.44,0.0,1.22,0.0,1.22,3.66,0.0,0.0,1.22,0.0,0.0,2.44,2.44,0.0,1.22,1.22,3.66,0.0,2.44,0.0,3.66,7.32,0.0,1.22,1.22,3.66,1.22,4.88,15.85,0.0,28.05,2.44,10.98,15.85,1.22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.41,8.54,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.88,0.0,0.0

Locolama,"It's surprising how much empathy certain Gaffers(incl. those in aswell as close to the moderation staff) have for criminals, rapists, murderers, terrorists and other lowlifes. Even more interesting is the rationale behind these comments... or rather its absence supported by a fundamental lack of any personal responsibility. Whenever I read these comments there's usually the same underlying message - it's always someone elses fault! You're either born that way or shoved into misery by some other stereotyped scapegoat like society or religion. That's the reasoning behind their whole miserable existence and also why you can't have an honest exchange of opinions with these people without being immediately singled out and ridiculed by them. Instead of taking charge of their own lifes and dealing with their angst, anxiety, depression or whatever other mental problem they might exibit, they'd rather comfort eachother in their little cirklejerk 'community' threads by indulging these illnesses. Happiness and self fulfillment takes effort and hard work, and can't be achieved by mutilating your body with gender reassignment surgery... or in case of Besada by eating away all that frustration with a nice greasy pizza. Hey if EvilLore conquered morbid obesity so can you! The real irony here is that while these freaks rather blame someone or something else for their miserable and disappointing existence, they actually brazenly belive they have the moral authority to dictate how other people should lead their lifes.",NeoFAG,t5_32psg,3,235.0,41.79,60.09,19.06,1.0,19.58,29.36,85.11,51.06,15.74,6.81,0.43,0.0,1.7,0.0,4.68,8.94,3.83,12.77,6.81,6.81,9.36,1.28,9.36,4.26,2.13,2.13,0.0,2.98,10.64,3.4,6.81,2.13,2.13,2.55,11.91,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.45,0.85,2.55,2.98,5.96,1.7,8.94,0.85,0.0,0.0,0.43,2.98,0.43,1.28,0.43,1.28,8.51,1.28,2.98,3.4,1.7,1.28,1.28,7.23,0.43,8.51,0.85,5.11,2.55,2.98,0.0,0.0,0.43,0.85,0.43,0.85,0.43,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.74,5.96,3.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.85,0.43,0.0,4.26,0.85,0.0

Let's look at some more examples.  Due to children consuming 100-200 grams of sugar per day they are experiencing a surge in obesity.  Therefore, in order to counteract this New Zealand will be partnering with Pfizer to add their blockbuster obesity drug to the water supply.  Side effects are minimal and can reduce childhood obesity by 60%.  Therefore we have a moral responsibility to the greater good to add Flubagra to the water supply.  Breaking news: Due to the rise in skin cancer and kiwis failing to cover up in the sun, we are partnering with Nivea to add sunscreen to the water supply.  Showering in the sunscreen will leave kiwis with a daily film of sunscreen on their bodies reducing skin cancer rates.  There is some concern of ingesting the sunscreen but studies conclude the side effects are minimal.  This just in: Kiwis are experiencing record levels of depression and suggestions of adding mood boosting drugs to the water supply are gaining momentum, ""People just don't got no time to meditate or exercise and eat well, so ya know we feelin down, to drink a glass of water and feel good is a no brainer"".",newzealand,t5_2qhma,-22,231.0,89.94,68.29,26.97,41.42,19.25,20.78,83.12,48.05,7.36,5.19,0.87,1.73,0.87,0.0,1.73,2.16,7.36,16.02,8.66,3.9,4.33,1.73,12.55,2.6,1.3,0.43,1.3,3.46,3.9,2.16,1.3,0.0,0.0,0.87,6.49,0.0,0.87,0.0,0.0,7.79,2.6,2.16,0.43,1.3,0.87,1.73,4.33,1.3,0.0,1.73,9.52,1.73,4.33,0.0,5.19,8.66,2.6,0.87,2.16,3.46,0.87,0.43,12.99,1.3,12.55,1.3,6.93,4.33,1.3,2.16,0.43,0.0,0.87,0.0,0.87,0.0,0.43,0.0,0.43,0.0,11.26,4.33,2.16,0.87,0.0,0.87,0.0,0.43,0.87,1.3,0.0,0.43

CasseToiAlors,"I hesitate to even engage you because your debate skills are truly sub par, but OK here we go... Lots of Northerners are Republicans and lots of Democrats are against welfare, so that ""point"" is already moot. Furthermore, many whites are also on welfare, so you're showing your true (racist and idiotic) colors by assuming that only non-whites receive government aid. Furthermore, it's not simply a question of being able to make it on one's own (a notion ironically very often spread by those born with a silver spoon) because many people that work overtime still can't afford to pay their bills because they get paid so damn little (thank you GOP for hindering attempts at raising the minimum wage to a LIVABLE wage). And there you go ignorantly assuming again; I AM a Southerner and I recognize the problems with that region of the country (it's the poorest, the least educated, takes in the most federal ""handouts"" to keep the state governments afloat, has the worst infrastructure, the highest infant mortality rates, the highest rates of obesity, believes in ludicrous Christian faerie tales, has the worst human rights records, etc.). And who said anything about voting for Democrats? One more assumption by the genius DonkeyRider. I'm not pushing my beliefs on anyone (based on your usage of the expression I don't think you understand what it means to push something on someone). I am, however, accusing the GOP of being actively interested in regressing our country to the time of robber barons.

DyestingTuck,"See, I find this so distracting from the whole reason for the thought experiment. If this was to decide a personal belief for day to day actions, then I guess you could have it your way, but when you use this thought experiment to the end it was designed, to put the individual in a position of authority to where any decision they make will be legal and have the force of legit authority behind it. Of course all of us who don't run the country can say ""hey the authorities we follow shouldn't send us to war, they should duel for victory to avoid loss of excessive life"", but that ain't reality. IRL there are people with authority to make a decision and in fact they are in position where they must make a decision. This is the position you are supposed to find yourself in. To say that you would sacrifice yourself obfuscates the point of the thought experiment on this level (like i said, it's fine to self sacrifice if it is for your personal philosophy, but we are talking about how we would like to see society run, not how we would behave given the choice ourselves). So the question is a two option question, and it needn't be yourself you place in the deciding role. Place a politician there. Since this is a human with a job, and not a job that they are willing to give their life for, they will not put themselves in front of the train. Or even imagine that this situation is remote (which is the usual way college profs stage this thought exp.), you are in a room miles away from the incident with only one button to push, the button that sacrifices one person to save the five, if you don't push it the five die. In this case the authority is demanded to act rationally by the people and save the five by sacrificing the one. If instead it is the organ dilemma then the people will expect you to recognize the individuals right to life instead of the five individuals right to your organs. This stuff has been studied ad nauseam. So my point is that if you only have the two option, there is zero reason to say the one person you have the option of train killing also happens to be fat.(in the experiment the whole point of the obesity is to give a reason why one person could stop a train with the sacrifice of their life, but it ends up coloring the peoples thoughts about that person, it makes more sense to say that the conductor simply won't brake until he sees human blood, the problem here is that it then gives people the option to say that they think there needs to be a third choice of randomizing who gets hit by the train, the whole point of the wording is to avoid the third option you wish to introduce which makes the experiment pointless politically)",philosophy,t5_2qh5b,1,506.0,76.31,90.04,22.18,22.7,36.14,15.61,94.47,57.91,14.82,7.71,0.79,1.38,3.36,0.2,1.98,7.11,11.07,14.23,9.49,4.55,5.14,1.78,18.97,2.17,0.4,1.98,2.77,1.19,2.96,0.99,1.19,0.4,0.4,0.2,13.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,16.01,5.14,3.95,3.56,3.16,0.59,3.16,2.17,0.79,1.19,0.0,1.58,0.4,1.38,0.0,0.4,5.34,1.38,1.38,2.57,0.59,0.99,1.38,13.04,1.78,11.07,1.78,6.72,2.57,1.78,0.0,0.2,0.0,1.19,0.59,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.88,2.96,3.95,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,1.38,1.19,0.0

AVGamer,"Well figuratively speaking we would save resources if we didn't have to accommodate obese people for everything. Just think about it, manufacturers have to make things which will support increasing weight across the population. More food needs to be produced, more material needs to be made for larger clothes (often more then twice the amount of material for obese), higher rates of diabetes and sickness from obesity meaning more demand for doctors etc. Having an ever increasing obese population is a very big issue for the efficiency and functionality of a populace.

You tend to wake up early, before sunup, so that you can eat something to last you til sundown.

6383,"5'5 and 116 lbs here, so slender but nothing unusual, and my legs look quite a bit like the ones in the picture, and standing with my legs together, there's a pretty noticeable 3-inch gap between my thighs. Conversely, my sister, who's a good 25 lbs underweight and has been genuinely diagnosed with anorexia nervosa doesn't have a thigh gap. If you have wide, angled hips and are relatively slim, you'll probably have a thigh gap regardless of whether or not you have an ED, and likewise, some people weren't built to ever have one. Ironic that organizations that proclaim to be body-positive are willing to ban certain models for their build, especially on the basis of a physical phenomena that really isn't exclusive to people who are underweight, and I strongly doubt that they would ever object to a model without a thigh gap on the grounds that it might promote obesity.

ClownWatch,"Theoretically, a caloric deficit ~3,500kcal/week can result in a loss of 0.5kg week. A strategy sometimes used in clinical situations to manage obesity is a diet focusing on a 600kcal/day deficit - higher compliance rates than a low calorie diet of 1,200kcal/day. Obviously, you could try utilise such a strategy although I would temper your expectations: in a review of 13 RCTs weight loss of -5.32kg was achieved compared with usual care at 12 months (before someone complains, I'm on my phone so won't be citing but I'm utilising research that was presented as a part of my master's). You're going to want to set realistic goals, the likes of losing 5-10% of your bodyweight over 3-6 months as success should motivate your continuation. There's a lot of diet strategies you can use. That RCT I mentioned above, treatments were focused on a low fat, high carbohydrate intake. Additionally, you may benefit from a high protein/low carbohydrate diet which is indicated as being more satiating, however, with the evidence I have at hand, the reductions aren't as significant. Another consideration is lowering the glycemic load of the diet, which appears to be an effective method of promoting weight loss. This latter option could quite easily be incorporated into the use of a low fat/high carbohydrate diet. Ultimately, for optimal weight loss you're going to want to combine a dietary intervention with a behavioural change - spend less time performing sedentary activities, try to increase your activities in daily living. Here are three general recommendations for physical activity: (1) at least 30 mins moderate intensity on 5 or more days, (2) 45-50 mins/day for obesity prevention, (3) 60-90 mins to maintain lost weight.",nutrition,t5_2qoox,1,294.0,93.47,60.73,27.14,3.31,26.73,26.19,76.53,41.16,7.82,5.44,2.38,0.0,3.06,0.0,0.0,2.38,7.48,15.65,8.84,2.04,3.06,0.68,13.95,7.14,4.08,0.68,6.8,2.38,6.46,2.04,4.42,0.0,0.34,3.74,4.76,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.56,1.36,2.72,2.38,3.74,0.34,2.04,2.38,0.34,0.34,1.7,6.8,1.36,4.76,0.0,5.1,10.88,0.0,5.44,4.42,2.04,2.04,1.7,8.84,1.7,13.95,1.7,7.82,4.42,3.4,0.0,0.0,0.34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.75,3.74,5.78,0.68,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.38,0.0,2.72,2.72,2.72

doedelflaps,Funny that you mention obesity. It's actually really relevant in the depression topic. Basically you could 'fix' obesity by simply take away all the food but you can't fix the way they eat too much. Modern psychology and doctors try to fix the 'you're overweight' with 'you should eat less' however they stop asking 'Why do you keep eating even though you know it will kill you?'. The same goes for being anorexic. They fix it by forcing teenage girls to eat more so they can have their phones back. If they eat another biscuit they get internet etc. They never actually apply any psychological help. At least not in the Netherlands. At most these people get 10 minutes to talk about themselves in group therapy. ,TrueReddit,t5_2qyt6,4,126.0,30.15,95.95,19.65,14.75,12.6,18.25,90.48,53.97,18.25,13.49,0.0,0.0,6.35,0.0,7.14,4.76,4.76,11.11,7.14,11.11,4.76,2.38,16.67,7.14,3.97,0.79,0.79,7.14,2.38,0.79,1.59,0.0,0.79,0.79,20.63,0.0,0.0,0.79,0.0,14.29,0.79,0.79,2.38,3.17,1.59,7.14,0.79,0.0,0.79,0.0,9.52,0.0,4.76,0.0,7.94,7.14,1.59,0.79,2.38,2.38,0.79,0.0,14.29,0.79,10.32,0.79,6.35,3.97,2.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.46,7.94,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.73,0.0,0.0

-_--___-_--_--___--_,"&gt;Whereas obesity has been stigmatized in the past, attitudes may be changing. To the extent that obesity is a product of voluntary choices or behaviors, the fact that people are embedded in social networks and are influenced by the evident appearance and behaviors of those around them suggests that weight gain in one person might influence weight gain in others. Having obese social contacts might change a person's tolerance for being obese or might influence his or her adoption of specific behaviors (e.g., smoking, eating, and exercising). In addition to such strictly social mechanisms, it is plausible that physiological imitation might occur; areas of the brain that correspond to actions such as eating food may be stimulated if these actions are observed in others.",funny,t5_2qh33,1,125.0,66.85,62.56,24.19,40.12,31.25,30.4,85.6,51.2,10.4,2.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6,0.8,8.0,5.6,13.6,13.6,2.4,7.2,0.0,15.2,1.6,0.8,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.8,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.8,0.0,0.8,0.8,0.8,19.2,0.8,5.6,0.8,8.0,2.4,5.6,3.2,0.8,0.0,1.6,9.6,0.8,4.0,0.0,8.0,6.4,2.4,1.6,2.4,1.6,0.0,1.6,6.4,4.8,12.8,5.6,6.4,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.4,4.8,4.8,0.0,1.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,1.6,0.8

katyne,"Nah, people who are really into cooking are rarely obese. They do like food but for them it's a hobby. Cooking requires creativity, patience and is a great way to relax and get some peace of mind. It's an aesthetic process bordering on pure science sometimes. Most people suffering from  obesity have no idea how to eat right and/or are too lazy to dedicate so much time and effort to the process. It's mostly sweets and junk food and sodas, consumed compulsively or on the go. They're not really enjoying what they eat, they sort of get high on it.

dustofoblivion123,"People embrace obesity because they are ignorant. I mean, I could educate them on the subject, but I think I'd rather let the laws of evolution do their job... The truth is, I'm a teacher, and I know that you can't educate people who don't want to be. That's why the first thing you usually have to do with children or teenagers who don't care is to make them care, to give them a reason for caring. Now you can do that with children relatively easily, but it's much harder with adults who already have a well established vision of the world. So if I can tell that there's a spark, a desire for change, no matter how deep within them it is buried, I will help them; on the other hand, if they're so far gone that they actually 'embrace' their condition, then they're not worth my time, as they have already decided their own fate.

States are cutting classes like civics, and music, and art, and even gym classes yet people complain when young people don understand how the government works, and obesity in children is getting worse. I went through high school in two states, New York and PA. Guess which state I saw fewer shitty teachers in. The one that paid its teachers well and did well by its students. New York teachers, at least the ones I had the good fortune to deal with were largely good teachers, and all of the bad teachers I remember were gone within three years.

Giant_irradiated_emu,"It was a time of great distress. Pepsi and Coke's rivalry had escalated into a full-scale war. As it progressed, other companies were forced to take sides. Eventually, the United States was divided into the Pringle's Republic of Coca-Cola (Coke, Pringles, Nintendo of America, Apple, and everything west of the Mississippi) and the Pepsi Empire (Pepsi, Wal-Mart, Sega of America, Lays, Miscrosoft, and Everything East of the Mississippi). Things had gotten so bad that a meeting was held at the United Nations. The representatives from each country walked into the United Nations building despite protesters and death threats. The meeting did not go as planned. Instead of discussing peace, the Coke and Pepsi representatives attempted to recruit other nations to their causes. After a long exchange of words, punches, tasers, and a bullet, an agreement was reached. Coca Cola would occupy Colorado, and Pepsi would occupy Wyoming, while the rest of the United Staes celebrated reunification. Peace lasted a whole two months before both companies tried to conquer their surroundings. The United Nations were forced to send in the combined forces of England, France, Canada, Norway, The United States, and the Avengers to defeat the psychotic soda companies.

Kmart1008,"There is also a strong correlation between the age the mother started her period and what age the daughter will start. I got my period at 11; my mom (born in 1942) got hers at 10, and my grandmother (mom's mom, born in 1913) got hers at 11. So it checks out in my family. I think when they say that average age of menarche (first period) is creeping downward, it's actually because of a  much higher rate of precocious puberty bringing the average down. That has a lot to do with childhood obesity. Age 10 would not be considered precocious puberty, and honestly it has always been a pretty common age to start.

tomorrowsanewday45,"3 meals is not ideal for dogs. You can't really compare a dogs feeding habits to ours, in the same way you can't compare cold tolerances of dogs to ours. Like I said before, wild dogs and canines don't get three meals a day, and can sometimes go a day or so without food, and manage to survive and thrive. My one lab gets fed once a day, she eats it as she wants, and has good body wieght and shape.

ae_and_iou,"So I have very similar stats to you (5'6ish, started out at 240, doing yoga and eating 1200 calories per day now) so your post gives me a lot of hope. Could you describe the intensity of your yoga, the length, and the frequency? I'm sorry people are being assholes about your post history. If people are content with staying fat, they aren't going to make substantial progress, even in this sub. Subs like fatpeolehate are motivating to people because they show you how your weight is holding you back in the real world. People treat fat people poorly, period. Want to know what people think when they look at you? Do look at that sub, and face reality. As a still fat person (175 now) though, I don't have a problem with that. I don't think it's a cultural thing, but a psychological one. When I overeat, I'm selfishly placing food over the opportunity to spend precious time with my partner or children at the end of my life. When I overeat, I'm risking not being able to hold a pregnancy due to my weight. I'm risking immobility, heart disease, or a stroke at end of life. I'm indicating my inability to control one of my most basic human functions. All of this has lead to my former obesity. Of course the rest of the world thinks that's unattractive.

Also I realized that my weight was a result of my laziness. The results weren't immediate and so I was discouraged. I would just go back to my old habits. I think that a lot of people are obese is because of the convince of our culture (in the US at least) has us accustomed to getting quick satisfaction. Honestly obesity shouldn't be tolerated. There are no benefits. It's simply calories in vs calories out. Your weight is directly in your control. Yes it can be very difficult to maintain a healthy weight. It's not impossible. People need to start taking personal responsibility for their actions. There is absolutely ZERO benefits, and quite frankly I'm tired of seeing compromises and excuses for it.

Graendal,"If you're using ""discouraging obesity"" as a euphemism for ""fat shaming"", the answer to what's wrong with it is that the science done about it shows that shaming fat people is generally more harmful than helpful when it comes to motivating them to lose weight. People who are supported instead of ridiculed are more likely to make positive changes in their lifestyle. Making them feel bad about it just backfires and they end up gaining more weight.

sixsidepentagon,"To hit on when you'd ""notice"" when your physical appearance would change, keep in mind it takes about excess 3500 kcals to gain a pound of weight; average human eats around 2000 kcals in a day. So even if you ate 3 times as much as a normal person would eat in a day, you'd only gain 1 pound of weight. Since nothing but a scale could notice that difference, it'd take a decent amount of time of eating excess calories before you notice a change in your physical appearance, depending on how much excess that is.

Hidden_One,Obesity is one of the leading causes of depression. Stress can also cause obesity; your body secretes a hormone called cortisol in response to stress. Elevated levels of cortisol have been linked to obesity. However cortisol is also very easy to lower: exercise (that's why you feel really good and relaxed after a workout). Cortisol is linked to the flight-or-fight response. Foods with vitamin C also lower it.,fatpeoplehate,t5_2x9xz,2,70.0,67.14,66.59,52.86,1.0,11.67,27.14,90.0,47.14,5.71,2.86,0.0,0.0,2.86,0.0,0.0,2.86,5.71,14.29,10.0,10.0,8.57,0.0,11.43,5.71,4.29,1.43,1.43,0.0,12.86,4.29,8.57,2.86,1.43,4.29,5.71,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.14,4.29,8.57,0.0,1.43,0.0,4.29,1.43,0.0,0.0,1.43,12.86,1.43,10.0,0.0,5.71,5.71,0.0,1.43,4.29,1.43,0.0,2.86,10.0,0.0,12.86,2.86,8.57,1.43,1.43,4.29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.57,8.57,0.0,1.43,1.43,0.0,0.0,2.86,0.0,1.43,2.86,0.0

Our body has mechanisms to handle this and if you are healthy they work better. Nearly 100% of cancer is due to random genetic changes during cell division (sometimes there is radiation exposure that causes the mutation). If you are obese, it is likely that your obesity was caused by same thing that causes inflammation and poor immune response. You will be sicker more often and less likely to handle the random genetic changes. So no, just being fat does not cause cancer, but it you are fat it is likely (if you got fat the same way most people are getting fat these days) you also have a compromised immune system and a higher cancer risk.

Gimmethemsugahs,To be fair it is actually a little hard to tell actual obesity numbers (because they can be very different among different demographics) and some data sets (for example:http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus13.pdf) do show a higher rate of overweight+obese among men (this data show the % that are healthy weight). Of course other data sets show more women being obese or roughly equal numbers of men and women. But the reddit 'fat' subs were largely born in response to FA and follow FA blogs a lot so obviously they are going to focus more on fat women. ,fatpeoplehate,t5_2x9xz,1,104.0,82.0,57.63,17.46,62.24,34.67,14.42,77.88,39.42,5.77,1.92,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.92,3.85,4.81,11.54,8.65,2.88,6.73,0.0,11.54,11.54,5.77,0.0,0.0,4.81,1.92,1.92,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.69,0.0,0.0,2.88,1.92,10.58,0.0,1.92,0.0,2.88,0.96,5.77,4.81,2.88,0.0,1.92,6.73,1.92,5.77,0.0,6.73,0.96,0.0,0.0,0.96,0.0,0.0,1.92,8.65,0.96,9.62,1.92,6.73,0.96,1.92,2.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.92,0.0,1.92,0.0,0.0,0.0,21.15,5.77,0.0,0.96,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.92,5.77,6.73

I don't see people lying in bed in too much pain to move, spewing vomit and diarrhea for like 48 hours because they haven't had a cupcake in two days.

While rates of obesity in a lot of industrialized countries are at or above 30% and combined overweight and obese are in the 60-70% range. I find it hard to believe 60-70% of the population is addicted to food.

AmeliaBedlia,"Before you get too married to your mission statement and program execution, I would make sure you're not duplicating services and that there are funders in your community that would underwrite your project. While a strong vision is fundamental to every nonprofit, if you are evaluating feasibility, you must consider funding prospects. Look into what foundations will grant to a project like yours and what type of metrics they require. Nowadays, many of these public health oriented (obesity, etc) funders want to see evidence based practices in use. That may require the support of skilled volunteers from the medical or public health fields. I can only speak for the projects I have worked on in the US, but this level of scrutiny has been a response to the recent recession. Foundations do not have the funds that they used to have so they are being more careful and skeptical of projects.

Because really, how many people do you know who can simply not play sports due to lack of endurance? Sure, they're growing in number, but most people can still manage. This might just have to do with the fact that fit people tend to stick together, or the fact that I live in Europe (the Netherlands) though.

ludeS,"Ya, the pre existing condition cases were unfortunate.  However, the way insurance works, the high cost patients get supported by the low cost patients.  We can say the insurance companies were to blame, but they are a business, and the majority of people dont care, they dont want their  cost to increase (it has to) to cover these people.  Its representative of their clients.  And like i pointed out, the obesity rate being what it is (which is reaally controllable, a lot of excuses about genetics.. which is partly true.  It just means your diet doesnt match your genetics.  I cant eat gluten,  Im not gluten intolerant according to the current definition, but my digestive track responds with anger and rage when i have it, went thru a LOT of doctors and likely unnecessary procedures to find that out.  So i dont eat things with gluten) the system cant be take take take.

INDABUTTYEAH,"Hey me too. I am pretty lazy and would love to do nothing all day for something. But there is a difference between Food Stamps and a System of Guarenteed income, mainly that as a whole our society has approved one and not the other. So, if we are talking about the current system of food supplementation, and not about an entire shift in societal policy on how to deal with the underclass, then I think it is relevant to look at what people are actually purchasing. Not just because it makes people who pay taxes feel supierior, (O it might be little bit of that sometimes) but also because as a whole the lowest classes are what tend to cost the tax payers money in terms of healthcare.  Part of the reason for that is that the lower classes tend to be the least healthy. Part of the reason for that is they tend to have a diet that is unhealthy. They tend to eat more processed food.  America is having an obesity epidemic, and sadly the poor class tend to be at the head of the race. The system as  it is now is nothing more than the government subsidy of the epidemic.  You can use a food stamps card at pretty much any convenience store, gas station snack rack to buy foods that have almost no nutritional value. If someone spends ten dollars in 7-11 buying a pizza, candy bar, and soda not only is that like five thousand calories of terrible they're ingesting right now, but that is also now ten dollars they don't have to spend on real food.

It can be overcome through dietary changes, but there are diseases where the basal metabolic rate is significantly lower than normal, so parents aren't necessarily stuffing tons of food down their kid's gullet and typically the disease also leads to other severe problems like organ failure and mental retardation.",fatlogic,t5_2wyxm,5.0,92.0,31.69,37.22,16.76,1.0,30.67,31.52,82.61,46.74,6.52,3.26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.26,3.26,2.17,11.96,10.87,9.78,10.87,3.26,10.87,7.61,5.43,1.09,0.0,2.17,7.61,0.0,7.61,0.0,0.0,2.17,6.52,1.09,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.22,0.0,3.26,2.17,3.26,1.09,5.43,1.09,0.0,0.0,1.09,8.7,0.0,5.43,0.0,5.43,15.22,1.09,5.43,7.61,1.09,5.43,0.0,11.96,0.0,11.96,3.26,4.35,4.35,4.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.09,1.09,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.13,3.26,6.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.09,0.0,3.26,0.0,0.0

Sociallypixelated,"While I understand your point of reinforcing the idea that companies hire their workforce based on presumption of capability via appearances. However, on that there was no disagreement. The question was, ""If one, why not the other"". I wasn't specifically referencing physically limiting ailments. Severe obesity or physically disabled would be an extreme and obtuse comparison to pregnancy. However there are chronic diseases that do not impair your ability to do your job daily but do require frequent monitoring. As well as lifestyle choices that increase the chance of needing an extended leave. Which is the presumed disadvantage of hiring women. Therefore if we find it logical to deduct in advance for eventual leave from work. It would be logical to do so for more than just pregnancy.  Or not at all if pregnancy is unlikely. If hiring practices are like insurance practices, unmarried women over 40 statistically are less likely to get married and have children if they have not already done so.

Quietuus,"I've done a fairly large amount of research on the issue myself, but I come to it from a more political and social issues stance. There are enough dissenting voices, ill-fitting data and deficiencies in studies for me to have serious doubts about both the prevalance and effects of obesity, particularly when we talk about people at the lower end of what is now considered obese (a definition category which has expanded quite dizzily over the last 20-30 years). I also seriously worry that particularly for a lot of people in this lower band (or those trying to avoid it) the mental and physical toll wrought by body image issues and haphazard attempts to control weight is going to do more damage than weight. One factor that we know exacerbates almost every other health condition and shortens the human life span is stress. Anywhere from 10-20 million plus Americans (depending on which figures you look at) suffer from eating disorders, a number which is growing. The long term and short term health effects of anorexia nervosa particularly are extremely serious; much worse than being somewhat overweight. I mean, it kills 15-20% of the people who have it according to long-range studies. Bulimia and other eating disorders are nice only by comparison. I also worry to what extent our cultural dialogues against fat produce medical harm; I'm sure if you've researched the issue you'll probably have come across the papers about how people who are considered overweight tend to access medical care less, how they are overdiagnosed or underdiagnosed certain conditions, how they are given the wrong doses for medication, refused treatment (and in the US refused health insurance) more often (often for little good clinical reason) and so on. I believe that these are inevitable consequences of treating obesity as an epidemic disease; as is the exaggerated fear of contagion you often see in reddit fat-haters, who seem to fear that those who would try and live with fat (particularly) are some sort of diabolical social cancer. Fat isn't contagious, it's not an illness to be fought with the efficiency of a military campaign; it's a very visible (and somewhat erratic) single indicator of health, diet and so on. The decision to treat it as an epidemic, to highlight its dangers, to focus on *this* problem specifically over so many others (particularly less visible problems like mental health generally) seems to me to be obviously a political matter. The treatment of fat people as sufferers from an epidemic disease tends to enable their dehumanisation, both in terms of the medical profession and ultimately in terms of subs like /r/fatpeoplehate.",Negareddit,t5_2vsbl,2.0,446.0,75.17,61.48,22.0,1.0,34.31,24.22,88.57,50.0,11.21,4.71,2.24,0.9,0.9,0.0,0.67,6.5,6.5,15.7,6.73,7.62,7.17,0.45,12.56,7.85,3.59,2.91,2.02,3.59,6.95,1.35,5.61,1.57,0.67,0.9,6.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.25,3.14,2.69,1.12,5.16,2.69,2.69,1.79,1.12,0.22,0.45,9.64,1.35,8.52,0.0,3.81,7.62,1.35,0.9,2.69,0.67,2.02,0.9,10.09,0.45,9.42,0.9,6.28,2.24,2.02,0.45,0.0,0.22,0.0,0.9,0.67,0.0,0.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.57,2.91,3.14,0.0,0.9,0.0,0.0,1.35,0.0,1.57,3.59,1.12

While obesity *is* a problem, it's a problem because of other things which negatively impact health, such as sedentary lifestyles, a lack of healthy food options, a lack of good nutritional education, and poverty (which ties many of those things together). When we focus on obesity *in terms of impact on health, we miss the opportunity to focus on its causes, and then we eventually get people like those in /r/fatpeoplehate who won't even acknowledge and even downright attack those that are trying to ameliorate or eliminate the root causes of obesity.

Two-HeadedBolognaGod,"Exactly.  The key to improving the current obesity situation isn't through shaming anyone.  Encouraging self-hatred and low self-esteems in the overweight and obese populations will only lead to a sense of helplessness and a lack of progress for these individuals.  If we emphasize activities, rather than the inherent ""badness"" of fat, maybe we can encourage those who aren't ready to change eating behaviors to at least incorporate more physical activity into their daily routines.  I notice that when you ridicule people and tell them what they're doing wrong, they take a defensive approach.

Meginzzz423,"Sorry if my comment came off as defensive. The thing that bothers me is that almost all the animals in this sub are overweight to varying degrees and it is unhealthy for ANY animal to be overweight. Having people comment that it is unhealthy for my animal to be overweight but not seeing a lot of similar comments on all the chunky kitties just made it seem like I was being called out. Obesity in companion animals of all species is a big problem. Just because horses are not as commonly posted does not mean there are no overweight horses. In the many years I have been working with horses, I have seen many more overweight horses than underweight ones. Perhaps people who do not see a lot of horses do not understand this because they have not been exposed to it. All the horse people I know who I have shown this photo to think it's really funny, not concerning. I think most people these days will agree that being overweight is unhealthy and that their overweight pets should be thinner, but it's still ok to share chunky animals in funny positions or situations and laugh about it. Anyways sorry /u/beautifulcreature86 if you felt like I overreacted to your comment but I do appreciate the concern you have for overweight animals.",Delightfullychubby,t5_2veo0,4.0,223.0,31.23,29.51,41.63,42.02,22.3,20.63,87.89,57.4,16.14,7.62,4.93,0.0,1.79,0.0,0.9,8.52,4.04,12.11,13.45,4.48,5.83,3.59,20.18,9.87,4.04,0.9,0.0,4.93,5.38,3.14,2.24,0.0,0.45,0.9,8.07,0.0,0.45,0.0,0.0,17.04,3.59,1.35,1.79,4.48,1.79,6.73,2.69,1.79,0.45,0.45,5.38,0.0,5.38,0.0,4.04,2.69,0.9,0.45,0.45,0.0,0.9,4.04,13.45,0.45,6.28,0.45,4.48,1.35,0.45,0.0,0.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.79,0.0,0.45,0.9,0.0,0.45,7.62,4.48,1.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9,0.0,0.9

Obesity is rising as a result of the economic turmoil that many people experienced over the past years. Families that tend to be low income have a higher obesity rate because they tend to fallback on fast food as their main choice for meals. Furthermore, many low income areas don't have stores that have healthy choices, they tend to be impacted by fast food establishments because it is an easy money source.

Childhood obesity is similar, the plastic bag looks far more dangerous than the cheeto. The kids walking home alone is another incident like that, it also cascades a bit because there aren't a whole lot of unsupervised children around anywhere any more. 10 kids playing on a sidewalk looks fine whereas two kids walking down a sidewalk looks like lost kids.

Always giving people excuses as opposed to blaming the fat shit's laziness and lack of willpower. I don't think there's even any science behind the claim that fat shaming leads to obesity.

whitestguyuknow,"That last bit would obviously make sense. But regardless of how you spin it, that doesn't mean that there's such a thing as ""skinny fat"" I mean, already starting off its an oxymoron. These are terms used by the timblrinas so that no one gets offended or triggered or whatever. Personally, if you're sensitive over *the words* fat or obese then that's they're problem, and they need to change something.  If you're talking about someone right under being classed as overweight, but have a high body fat percentage, then they know they need to lose some weight. Just by looking at the bmi scale if you see you literally about to cross over into obesity, you can say *right now* you're within a the healthy weight range, but with being in the edge you know you need to lose weight. Labelling all these obese people as something different and breaking them down into classifications isn't helping at all. ""Oh but I'm a *small* fat. I'm not one of those *massive* obese slobs!"" It's creating an opportunity for more of them to use a new type of cop out. It should just obese then severely obese. People within the healthy range the bmi scale gives but are close to being technically obese, can still say they're overweight and bring themselves closer to the middle by changing whatever bad habits they have. Goes the same with people who are underweight too.

But restaurants don't serve ""human adult portions.""  If you actually *can* finish a spaghetti dinner at a casual dining or mid-range chain restaurant, there is something seriously wrong with your body.  I worked at one of these places, and even morbidly obese people usually couldn't finish a portion.  And we *still* had people (usually wealthyish middle aged men who were relatively slim, and putting half of their meals in boxes anyway) bitching about how small our portions were for the price.  People are *angry* that 4000 calorie meals cost 11 dollars.    Even if restaurants scaled back their prices along with portion sizes, people have gotten used to having disgusting amounts of food for no money, and would feel ripped off.  The combination of increasing portion sizes and a ""but that's *wasteful*"" attitude that was cultivated at a time when people actually *lacked* in this country is an extremely major contribution to why we have such a problem with obesity.

It's everywhere, nearly all packaged foods are made with vegetable oils (canola, soybean oil, etc) and so it's best to be conscious of this and limit intake where you can. Walnuts are fine in moderation and not an issue as long as they are not a staple of your diet which I assume they won't be and the primary source is cooking oils so if you're avoiding them a few nuts won't be an issue. This isn't a keto-concern, for keto fat is fat. It's a higher level concern but as keto is about overall health something to mention and consider.

Herbert_Sherbert,"Random advice from internet stranger: You should tell your big-boned friend to try acid reflux meds.  [Something like 60%-75% of asthmatics have acid reflux](http://www.webmd.com/asthma/guide/heartburn-asthma), and most obese people in general have it as well (due to the obesity and associated massive intake of food), and their asthma symptoms will often improve when they start taking PPIs (such as nexium/omeprazole).  What happens is the acid reflux comes up, especially at night when people are lying down, and the acid has no where to go so it goes into your lungs.  This causes a lot of inflammation obviously and makes it feel like your 'asthma' is really bad.  Asthma meds can also make reflux worse.",fatlogic,t5_2wyxm,1.0,125.0,55.96,86.87,13.57,14.68,25.0,12.8,84.0,45.6,9.6,4.8,0.0,0.0,3.2,0.0,1.6,4.8,3.2,12.8,7.2,8.0,8.8,0.8,16.0,6.4,4.8,3.2,1.6,1.6,4.0,1.6,2.4,0.0,0.8,0.0,9.6,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,11.2,0.8,2.4,0.8,4.8,1.6,0.8,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,10.4,0.8,8.8,0.0,2.4,8.0,0.8,1.6,3.2,0.8,1.6,0.0,14.4,0.8,13.6,2.4,6.4,4.8,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.8,0.0,25.6,5.6,3.2,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.4,0.0,1.6,4.8,7.2

wateryouwaitingforq,You might be interested to learn that the vast majority of what accounts for obesity isn't exercise but what you eat.  A human can literally sit still (not good for humans but still) and simply eat an extremely low calorie high nutrition diet and lose weight.  The hard part is convincing an obese person that this is true and that all they have to do is eat this way.,funny,t5_2qh33,1.0,69.0,27.23,61.42,35.93,52.99,23.0,14.49,97.1,56.52,14.49,4.35,0.0,0.0,2.9,0.0,1.45,10.14,7.25,7.25,13.04,5.8,7.25,2.9,20.29,5.8,0.0,2.9,0.0,4.35,7.25,4.35,2.9,0.0,0.0,2.9,8.7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.49,2.9,0.0,0.0,1.45,4.35,5.8,2.9,0.0,0.0,2.9,13.04,0.0,7.25,0.0,10.14,5.8,0.0,1.45,2.9,1.45,1.45,0.0,20.29,1.45,10.14,0.0,7.25,2.9,1.45,1.45,0.0,1.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.7,4.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.45,2.9,0.0

damanas,"Calling it a hormonal issue is probably a bit misleading because you're virtually (maybe with Cushing's disease or on a combo of a topical and systemic corticosteroids) never going to get them without stretching as well. They are ultimately a result of skin damage, so maybe if you have already dry skin moisturizers can help a tiny bit. In obesity I'm not really sure. I don't think obese people consistently have increased cortisol levels, though some do.

I think it's a good reminder but it's the same reason ""think of your family/pets/kids"" doesn't often work for suicidal people. Your priorities are altered. You can't perceive consequences and you feel trapped. By the very nature of these disorders, you don't just *feel* helpless, you *are* helpless. I don't think shame or even well intended reminders about the impact you have on others really matter.

ThatGuyNobodyKnows,"Do you honestly think that is the whole fucking problem with obesity? That people don't know that eating fast food and other unhealthy foods will make them fat? That's like the most basic thing about biology. People fucking understand it. It's just that there are 2 voices in some of our heads when we see unhealthy foods. One that says you should definitely take a bite out of that chocolate bar, because you know that it is, in fact, delicious. The other one says it'll make you fat, its unhealthy, and you should watch your weight. I believe that when people listen to he 1st voice they are ignoring the 2nd voice on purpose. So no, I don't think people should be taught this in school. If it was that fucking easy for everyone, that would be so simple.

Mjholm,"Thank you for this very well written and researched article. Lucy absolutely needs to move to a warmer climate and soon, before it's too late for her. The City of Edmonton and The Valley Zoo resist this despite offers to cover all costs. This is because Lucy is their attendance draw and their fund raising cash cow. They keep claiming Lucy is old and would not survive the move. This is what all zoos say that fight to keep their elephants. Lucy is not old, she is only 39 and could have many good years left if she is moved to a sanctuary. Elephants can survive as long as humans with a proper environment and care. Sadly Lucy will not survive much longer here in Edmonton. All her medical ailments are aggravated by our cold dry climate. The biggest concern is the fact that she can't breathe through her trunk. All her problems can be attributed to this climate which should be foreign to any elephant. Lucy's enclosure is so small and because of the cold climate, she is only able to get out 1/3 of the days. She lacks exercise which is also aggravating her obesity and arthritis. Elephants normally roam many miles a day and she is unable to do that. Keeping her alone is cruel as she is a herd animal. This is a violation of the Alberta Zoo standards and deemed cruel by any elephant expert. This are highly social animals and spending time with only humans is not acceptable. All advocates for Lucy ask is that her current ailments be assessed by an independent expert and a determination be made as to her fitness to be moved safely.She deserves to live out her remaining years in the company of other elephants in a warm spacious sanctuary. Calgary and Toronto have moved their elephants south, what is wrong with Edmonton? First they claim Lucy is doing just fine here but then suddenly she is too sick to move.

In India poor people starve to death or injure their kids so they are more effective beggars. ,worldnews,t5_2qh13,-7.0,59.0,36.24,75.12,6.41,1.0,19.67,15.25,93.22,52.54,11.86,8.47,1.69,3.39,0.0,0.0,3.39,3.39,3.39,13.56,11.86,6.78,10.17,1.69,13.56,6.78,1.69,0.0,3.39,3.39,10.17,3.39,6.78,0.0,1.69,0.0,16.95,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.56,1.69,1.69,3.39,3.39,3.39,6.78,1.69,0.0,1.69,0.0,5.08,1.69,3.39,0.0,3.39,15.25,3.39,3.39,6.78,1.69,1.69,1.69,10.17,0.0,5.08,0.0,3.39,1.69,3.39,0.0,0.0,6.78,0.0,1.69,3.39,3.39,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.78,5.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.69,0.0,0.0
DnBb,"It's a result of surplus industrialized corn production. They will find any way to use cheap overabundant corn to feed Americans with starch based ""food"". It was okay when trying to get calories into the bodies of starving depression era people. But today, it's the obvious catalyst in America's obesity and diabetes epidemic. Manufacturers are aware that starch broken down as sugar in the body makes one more hungry and in turn makes people buy/consume more products. And unfortunately the government subsidized commercial agriculture system is based around corn production from the corn grown for these derivatives/isolates, the corn fed to the animals(even fish) that humans eat and also in the form of ethanol that fuels vehicles(which uses more energy to produce than is gained). Farmers have increased production instead of slowing production and creating demand when prices drop so there becomes a need to engineer ways to sell more corn based garbage.

Being fat is is not a natural state of being like being gay, or trans, or what have you.  Obesity is something you do to yourself, AND it's fucking terrible for you.  The fat acceptance movement strikes me as just another part of this slowly growing philosophy that the world owes it to people that they should never get their feelings hurt.  A cute idea, but it's never gonna happen.  Ultimately what fat acceptance should boil down to is the idea of self-acceptance.  You can be happy being fat without other people agreeing with you.  If you're really content with it, then it shouldn't matter how other people view it.

TheMoonEmoji,"I feel like the general premise of the movement has good intentions. Of course, we shouldn't allow others to bully people or shame them for the way they look. But encouraging others to feel better about themselves by telling them that they can be ""healthy at any size"" is simply false and is detrimental to the loads of unhealthy people following this movement. Getting people to accept their looks through a lie is wrong. It sends a bad message to children struggling with weight and makes obese adults complacent.

It's a social and societal problem (not just a personal trouble) and we should be focusing more attention to that than we have been, in society. Outside factors affect individuals in a society more than we would like to admit. You can't watch tv, go into a store, stand in a check out line, etc. without being bombarded with junk food or junk food advertisements. It's everywhere and now with the rise in overweight people it is even becoming socially accepted, which makes it even more difficult to break away, as it is becoming a societal norm. Think about being a meth addict who wants to quit and not being able to go anywhere without meth advertisements, or meth being offered at all stores, and hey what about that fast drive through meth store..it's super cheap! Oh, and don't forget about your family, your friends, your coworkers who are also meth addicts.

If they don't want to, they dont have to, but they should pay higher insurance premiums because their life choices lead them to have worse health outcomes. I shouldnt be stuck covering their higher medical requirements because of choices they make. Being fat, in the majority of cases, is a choice, not just something that occurs due to happenstance. I can definitely see obesity as a manifestation of deeper psychological issues (ie depression) but even more reason for us as a community to not just accept that being fat is ok.

Peachypeachypeach,"Many medications, Anti-psychotics especially, but also some anti-depressants, hormone therapies, and steroids as well, can cause serious weight gain sometimes up to 60 pounds in a matter of months. Partly this is due to an effect on energy metabolism, and partly a change in appetite that can occur in conjunction with the medication. PCOS is a common one too in women. It's not impossible to lose weight with it by any means, it's just difficult when you're body is in a cycle of addiction with sugar because the spiking and dropping insulin levels cause cravings, mood swings when you refrain, nausea if you get too hungry etc. I have PCOS, as well as celiac disease that's caused nutrient malabsorption (iron deficiency among other things), so my cravings are pretty intense sometimes since I'm not absorbing vitamins/minerals correctly. Primarily the sugar and calories are absorbed from my food, and that means extra weight gain with PCOS. Hypothyroidism is also a big indicator with sudden weight gain at middle age. Honestly though, I think for most people obesity is just the outer manifestation of food addiction/ binge eating disorder type behaviour or a lack of nutritional education.

BattMastard,"I don't believe in bullying, fat shaming or discriminating, and I don't see overweight people as any less human either. I see obesity as a health issue just like smoking, alcoholism, or drug addictions. I was 50 lbs overweight and lost it all last year simply by reducing the amount of carb/sugar-heavy foods and drinks I consume. I didn't do it because I was bullied or because people didn't love me. I simply wanted to be healthier and stop feeling like shit all the time (I used to have no energy and terrible heartburn before changing my diet.) This ""fat acceptance"" movement seems to encourage people that are overweight to just accept how they are, rather than motivating them to improve their health and lose weight. It spreads a dangerous belief that some people are just ""naturally fat"" because people come in ""all shapes and sizes"" as if it's a simple genetic trait like skin color or height. There is a reason obesity has skyrocketed over the last few decades, it's simply the massive increase in sugary/empty caloried foods we eat. Our genes did not just suddenly change in one or two generations to make us fat. But people like Meghan Trainor will keep sending the message that ""every inch of you is perfect so just keep being fat"" when people need to realize that it's a serious health issue that needs to be fixed.

M33p3rs,"I generally agree with the sentiment here that being fat is not healthy, but hear me out. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and in my personal experience, Fat Acceptance has been beneficial to people mentally. I am not advocating the glorification of being obese, but I am however advocating body positivity. Someone who is very close to me had her life changed by this. She went from chronic depression, which caused binge eating and bulimia (and in turn suicidal thoughts), to someone who is comfortable in her own skin. The movement made her feel less hopeless, and less like she should be ashamed of herself. She is still dissatisfied with her weight but feels like she shouldn't need to change for anyone but herself. Like most situations, I think it would be ill advised to proclaim that Fat Acceptance is either good or bad, because it can be both. Instead, I think a case by case approach is more appropriate.

snallygaster,"Pure fat acceptance isn't the answer, but outright shame/bullying isn't either. If it were only a matter of fat being unhealthy, shame might be the answer, just as it has curtailed smoking addiction and drunk driving, but fat is also considered ugly, so calling somebody a 'fat fuck', 'piggy', etc. is essentially calling them ugly as well. Which, of course, can lead to insecurity and mental health issues, since being called ugly is a very crippling insult to many people.  This can cause problems in the form of anorexia, bulimia, or even more binge eating, since food is a great comfort/diversion. Of course, fat acceptance is also pretty awful given that the movement enables unhealthy eating habits and gives fodder for people to rationalize away their fatness. I think that encouragement and reward for healthy habits and (healthy) weight loss are the best way to tackle the problem, along with widespread education about how to eat healthily and the consequences of obesity (and the positive consequences of fitness!).

pishpasta,"I think this ultimately comes down to whether or not you think obesity is a choice.  So much of the emerging research on obesity suggests that obesity is not a choice.  Who would choose to life a shorter life and increase their likelihood of medical problems, while simultaneously reducing their enjoyment of some of the great stuff in life...feeling good in a wedding dress, enjoying a pool party, feeling confident enough to ask someone out on a date...not that these things are not possible if you are obese, but they are more difficult.  As someone who has been overweight myself and who now studies obesity, I feel that obesity is not really a choice.  Ultimately, yes, you choose to put the food in your mouth, but an incredibly complex number of neurological and physiological chemicals influence your choice.  For one, genetic factors that you have absolutely no control over.  Epigenetic factors passed down generations that you have absolutely no control over.  The food industry has changed what is in food (increasing carbs and sugar, no fiber) to make your insulin levels spiral out of control. This triggers insane cravings that are nearly impossible to resist.  You gain weight, and then to top it all off, societal standards of what is beautiful and ""acceptable"" to look like make you feel even worse.  It's truly an injustice.  Yet people who have always been skinny are quick to say, ""Obesity is a choice.""  Yeah, just like anyone rich believes, ""I pulled myself up by my own bootstraps.""  Sure, the American Dream of being skinny is possible for all, but without giving some people a leg up (nutrition education, food stamps that pay for fresh fruits and veggies, psychological support to give people coping mechanisms other than eating, trainers, access to gyms and safe neighborhoods to walk in, etc.), we shame people unjustly.

pokemaniacemily,"I'm not sure about that (though I've heard that at least for female African Americans the BMI doesn't work very well), but I was more talking about diabetes than obesity. 41% of Nauru have diabetes compared to 2-8% diabetes in ethnic Europeans in Europe and the US/Australia (the latter being the 8%, the former being the 2%). US Pima have 50% diabetes prevalence. Obesity and diabetes are related due to high sugar intake and insulin spikes promoting fat storage with type 2. The main point is that there are certain populations of people that are of normal weight whilst pursuing traditional lifestyles, but then are very susceptible to morbidity under industrialized/modern lifestyles and western foods. So some populations have more ""thrifty genes"" than others, and it seems to be related to food security, so obesity/diabetes is more prevalent in some groups but I'm not sure if that means that it's ok for them to have extra fat. I'd have to look into it, but I'd bet Samoans could be their own group (but maybe not others).

If someone is eating because they just don't give a  shit and aren't happy isn't going to encourage anything, at best I think it will make people want to hide and to use what temporarily makes them feel better, food.

lnpeters,"Wow, who would have thought a motivating post would get me negative points? Is it because I said biology is stronger than willpower? Hate to burst the bubble, but biological drives cause us to seek out sweet tasting things, cause us to eat as much of it as we can, and telling people that they have poor willpower (and that's why they're failing) is a deprecating and unhelpful attitude. I believe the key to gaining control over your diet involves setting yourself up for success and understanding the underlying biological workings of your own body. We're predisposed to fail. Knowing that, and failing, isn't a cop-out. It's an explanation. And beating yourself up about failing, or cheating, is just one more way to make fat people feel shame for their own condition. Obesity is a hormone imbalance. If someone had a thyroid problem, would you shame them about it? Would you say that their symptoms are because they don't have enough willpower? No, because it's a biological issue. Dieting needs to be treated the same way, as a hormonal imbalance (insulin.) Stop shaming folks for not being able to adhere to the diet, and start educating them on why their body makes them crave food.",keto,t5_2rske,2.0,206.0,48.93,87.8,3.62,1.81,14.71,25.73,86.89,53.88,16.02,10.19,1.46,1.94,2.91,0.0,3.88,5.83,6.31,12.62,11.17,2.43,7.77,2.43,18.93,4.85,3.4,1.46,0.49,0.97,6.8,1.94,4.85,0.97,0.97,1.94,13.59,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.56,3.4,5.34,3.4,1.46,0.0,2.91,2.43,0.0,0.97,0.49,9.22,1.46,4.37,0.0,4.37,13.11,1.94,4.37,6.8,1.94,2.91,0.97,14.56,0.0,5.83,0.49,3.88,0.97,4.85,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.45,4.85,5.83,0.0,0.0,1.94,0.0,0.49,0.0,3.4,1.94,0.0

Argus_Eye,"There was something I was half-watching a few weeks ago, I forget what it was called or on what channel. It described how as human animals, we're wired to enjoy fat and sugar more than anything else, because they possess the densest caloric ratio. They're also about the least-healthy compounds in large quantities, and our predecessors were protected from this because sugar and fat are the most rarely occurring in nature - meat, fruit, tubers, et al, were all hard-to-find or hard-to-catch (and in the process of finding/catching the next, we burned much of what we'd stored). Now, lots of us sit at desks all day long, sugar is in *everything*, and meat-based protein is at virtually every meal - most of the top killers in our culture (obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke) are at least partially attributed to this chronic and systemic over-consumption. This doesn't necessarily speak directly to lean, boneless skinless chicken, but the expectation of its availability is symptomatic of the consumption problem.

meowlalafell,"I agree. I'll have to say that on the other end of fat logic, it is well known that some models have histories of going through dangerous methods to lose weight and become unhealthily thin. Of course, to FAers there's either obese or anorexic, but I think it's important to see normal-sized models like her because I think body acceptance needs to be for healthy-bodied people who feel the pressure to go to dangerous lengths to become incredibly thin. This model looks healthy and fit. Body acceptance should focus on health and fitness with looking good as an obvious side-effect. Unfortunately, the body acceptance movement is more about accepting obesity (hell I think they've already accomplished normalizing obesity but they just find shit to complain about because if they stopped they'd lose who they are).",fatlogic,t5_2wyxm,13.0,138.0,58.77,44.24,72.78,38.67,23.0,22.46,92.03,47.83,13.77,7.97,3.62,0.0,0.0,0.72,3.62,5.8,2.9,15.22,10.14,4.35,7.25,0.0,21.74,7.97,2.9,1.45,0.0,2.17,13.77,7.25,6.52,0.72,1.45,1.45,7.97,0.0,0.0,0.72,0.0,18.84,10.14,2.17,2.17,2.17,0.72,4.35,4.35,2.17,0.72,1.45,9.42,4.35,5.07,0.0,4.35,5.8,0.0,2.17,0.72,0.72,3.62,2.9,15.94,1.45,9.42,2.17,4.35,2.9,1.45,0.72,0.0,0.0,0.72,0.0,2.9,1.45,0.0,0.72,0.72,0.0,14.49,4.35,2.9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.17,0.0,3.62,1.45,0.0

Our fear of confronting our own flaws doesn't simply make us find flaws in others, it makes us fixate on the flaws in others that we possess, perhaps to reinforce an illusion that others are different (i.e., that we do not possess those flaws we observe). For example, I don't go around noticing how fat other people are, or I don't criticize the obesity in my head or find it to be a flaw if I even notice it. Not coincidentally, I am not fat myself. I also don't really call people stupid; not that I'm smart, but it's just that I'm not intellectually insecure.

I thought it would be good for the both of us too. I'm gonna do it, I'd just like to know why you said all of that about how unfair that gyms don't offer 6 weeks free to fat people, because if they did you wouldn't be fat anymore, and then bam, FREE 8 weeks to the gym of your choice.  Help me understand that please.  You said you're fat and want to fix it and think the gym is the answer.  What else do you want?  Seems like fat shaming is onto something.  My guess is you said all of that for sympathy, and when a real offer came in to help you didn't accept cause you didn't want to get off your ass and go to the gym and also be held accountable.  I'm not being mean, I'm telling you how I feel in a very serious tone.  Health is the most important thing anybody has.  I'm serious about helping you.  I'm not rich, but I'll do this if it can help change your life.  I wouldn't hesitate a moment to do that for anyone.   Like I said though, you must take the initiative.  You must PM me.

Arya_Natsuki,"So, I think it is unfair to state that obesity is not an issue here... There is not enough information to know. We do not know the heights of these women in the images. If you were to make me a size 8-14, I would most definitely be obese (i am 5'3""). My pant size is 0 and I am of a healthy body habitus. My body fat percentage ranges from 9-14% and my waist to hip ratio is roughly 0.7 (which has been shown to be the primary indicator of attractiveness across the board. Being thin or having big boobs did not matter anywhere near as much as the waist to hip ratio. It is also an indicator of health, above a certain level is considered unhealthy). So, if the women in the images are just larger but are proportional (maintaining a decent bf% and waist-hip ratio), then it is fine to say these women are healthy.  But with so many unknowns, it is impossible to say. Being a size 0 is not bad or too thin nor is size 2-6. They are normal, healthy sizes women can fit into (depending on height, the taller you are the greater pant size is expected). Also, lying to women about what men find attractive is not an acceptable answer to the present problem...

Also bulletproof coffee makes me feel full almost all day and I don't really feel the need to eat anything else, although I don't drink it every day it definitely has an impact which I think mostly is the result of the mct oil which you can also take yourself.

Gizortnik,"For some reason /u/MisterMetal brought up the idea of weight as a counter-argument against revolution by citing a statistic saying that 70% of the American population is obese and associated that the wildly obese people of the US really have no ability to revolt *because* of their fitness. First off, MisterMetal is basically thinking that the American population is so overweight as to stop them from being basically functional, like his comparison of a prepper weighing in at 400 lbs. This isn't true, most Americans are not so overweight as to impair their ability to breath. So, I pointed out the flaw in that obesity measurement by pointing out that people who are very athletic are also probably listed as obese or morbidly obese, which impairs his argument.

Placebo_Jesus,"I can accept that there is some genetic predisposition to being fat, just as there is genetic predisposition involved with oh say heroin/opioid addiction and criminality.

You should be shamed if your habits are hurting your health and well-being, because society bears the costs of that in both the drug addict and food addict via increased health care costs, so we have a right to denounce it. Fat does not equal healthy, that's a scientifically established fact (correlation with a host of health problems of the cardiovascular and diabetic variety has been well demonstrated, it probably extends beyond that). I even believe society has a mutual obligation to offer supportive services (let me be clear, I mean health/exercise/weight loss resources not cranes for moving their fat asses out of bed) for those with morbid obesity just as we should offer such services to drug addicts, all in the name of furthering pro-social goals and productivity.

If one-third of Americans are obese and another third are overweight, does that mean that there was suddenly a large spike in personality disorders in the past few decades, or does it just indicate that the majority of people have always had poor impulse control but weren't able to fully indulge in bad choices until crummy food was made more widely available?

Same for unemployment, I imagine as in the UK any worker who can afford it will also have private unemployment insurance, and the only people who don't will be the poor, the very people welfare systems are set up to help.",PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,5.0,157.0,66.21,75.83,10.21,1.31,39.25,24.84,88.54,56.05,12.1,5.73,1.91,0.64,1.27,0.0,1.91,6.37,8.92,14.01,10.83,5.1,7.64,1.91,14.01,5.1,3.82,3.18,0.64,1.91,6.37,1.27,4.46,0.64,1.27,1.27,12.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.55,1.91,0.64,1.27,2.55,1.91,3.18,0.64,0.64,0.0,0.0,2.55,0.0,2.55,0.0,1.27,10.83,2.55,2.55,7.01,0.64,1.27,0.0,10.19,2.55,7.64,1.91,4.46,1.27,5.1,0.0,1.27,4.46,0.0,0.64,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.46,3.18,4.46,0.0,0.0,0.64,0.0,0.64,0.0,2.55,0.0,0.0

Ontoforever,"That does sound like a good routine! And don't think that you need to change a bunch of things at once. It often fails. Charles Duhigg says in his book that radical change usually doesn't stick. He tells a story about doctors treating obesity. They used to tell obese people that they needed to change their diet, start an exercise program, and basically turn their lives 180 degrees from where they were if they wanted to lose weight and not die from being so unhealthy. So these people would throw away the junk food, start going the gym, and take the stairs instead of the elevator. Shortly afterwards, however, they would go back to doing what they'd always done. So, eventually the doctors decided to try something different. They asked obese people to keep a food journal and write down everything they ate or drank. People started keeping these journals. Sometimes they would forget, but gradually they remembered more and more. After a while, they would start eating less. They would even start doing all the things that the doctors wanted them to do in the first place: they started going to the gym and taking the stairs.

QueenSkittlez,"I find it pretty hilarious that constant weight changes are apparently the absolute worst thing for your body. Think about literally any mammal ever that lives in a place with more than one season: winter fattening. They all store up fat for a scarcity of food. Now, not really to the point of obesity unless they're in contact with people, but still. Weight changes are natural. Your weight will change with the season, the time of day, your activity level, anything. Gaining or losing weight is in and of itself not a particularly harmful or harmless thing. It's neutral. It happens. It is how you do it, by binges and starvation (which usually result in some for of malnutrition), that make it unhealthy.

For a trait to become common in a species it has to not just be passed on, but be passed on more than competing traits. Currently the human body hoards calories in the form of fat. For a trait to overcome this propensity towards obesity it would need to make the individual and the individual's offspring better at reproducing. As it stands, most of the obesity-related illnesses we deal with don't have a serious adverse health impact until after reproductive age.

Papi_Ima,"I went up to 190 on Abilify so I know that horror. It wasn helping my mood so much I wanted to stay on it so badly.  I felt normal and capable. I was also asked if I was pregnant. The obesity just became too much and unsafe though.  Lithium like, broke my pussy.  It felt almost like when you get novicane at the dentist.  No feeling. No response.  No wetness.  No pleasure. Nothing.  I was like hell no, my pussy's broke- and I threw it in the garbage.  But it doesnt matter if you're so non functional that you don't date or have sustainable relationships anyway.  I get the hyper-sexual thing too.  I'm happy when I'm like that and don't see it as a problem.  Sometimes I remember having sex with my boyfriend when I didn't feel like it, and by the time we were half way through, I was at least partially into it so I felt like I was getting something out of it too. Not everyone feels this way though. I know someone whose husband didnt have sex with them for a year because of depression.  It happens. Also, sometimes when I was heavy I just couldn't deal with showing my body to my partner, so before we lose the weight, it can be hard to have sex too.  Was for me.  I am impressed that you are out in the world enough to have a boyfriend and a live in one at that.  That sounds normal and nice. Congratulations.  For real.

thelitteratti,"The thing about these kinds of studies is that the more similar everyone's environments are,  the more ""heritable"" things will appear. Heritability is a measure of how much of the variance between people is due to factors in their genes vs factors I  their environment. So for height,  the reason it is so heritable in the US is because most people have access to adequate nutrition in childhood so we're all able to reach our ""maximum genetic height"". The case with weight  is similar. This doesn't prove that obesity is caused by genes,  it just shows that some people,  all other things being equal,  will eat more food and be heavier than others because of different hormone balance,  satiety signals,  etc. That doesn't mean it's impossible for them to lose weight if they try,  it just means that it may be harder for them to maintain a healthy weight without putting conscious effort into it because their body signals may prompt them to eat more than they really need. And anyways the majority of people aren't obese,  so most of the variance observed in a study like this would be between normal weight people and other normal weight people or slightly overweight people. No doubt 500lb people are outlier in this regard.

Nakji,"What you are talking about is called a protein sparing modified fast. It is an extreme short-term weight loss protocol that should not be undertaken without either medical supervision or a very thorough understanding of nutrition and very carefully selected set of foods/supplements. PSMFs are extremely unpleasant to be on and not really worth it in my opinion, but they are the gold standard in extremely rapid fat loss. With that said, if you're just trying to lose a few pounds, there's absolutely no reason to use a PSMF - you can lose a few pounds in a few weeks of normal dieting without resorting to such extreme measures.

lollappaloosa,"Having a good metabolism is also a myth, I have hypothyroidism..that ""condition"" that people always blame their obesity on.

Gott-Mit-Uns,"America could have been great but was destroyed by several things. One, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 passed by the Jew Emmanuel Celler. By dividing America ethnically, the enemies of the United States now face a mongrelized population. Also in the 60s, the Jews behind feminism succeeded in weakening the traditional family unit and increasing promiscuity and divorce. Even worse than the immigration was the capitalist shill GOP of the 80s where Reagan tripled the national debt and religious fundamentalism took root. The Republican party took credit for being anti immigrant while they actually did nothing to solve the problem, instead profiting off of it when fruit and crop prices lowered due to cheap illegal labor. With the efforts to promote 'gay marriage', transgenderism, the increase of obesity, the sheer amount of time Americans spend consuming media on phones and other electronics, and the increase of marijuana and other drug use, the country is headed for social destruction. The 'conservative' Republican party is run behind the scenes by people like Sheldon Adelson (oy vey, regulation is theft) and  conservatives are only a minor speed bump on the liberal road to social ruin. **TLDR all of the current social changes in America are exactly what I would support in other countries if I were attempting to subvert them. We will see America become a terrible place to live with an ever shrinking middle class and no sense of culture or identity whatsoever** Fascism in America will exist but in private communities.

Druyx,"Fast food doesn't make you fatter than any other food. You get fatty, carb loaded home cooked meals as well. Weight gain/loss is a function of calories in vs calories used. The problem with how fast food contributes to obesity is their reliance on starches to make the customer feel ""full"". Notice how the calories increase dramatically in those meals the moment you add chips (or other starches such as the mash or a pizza). Most healthy adults can maintain their weight if they stick to around 1800-2000 calories a day. The problem, I believe in anyway, is that you have these starch filled takeout lunches but feel hungry again in the evening and you eat again pushing you over that and resulting in weight gain.

Their quality of life will deteriorate quickly. They will die. And they will continue to burden/hurt everyone who has ever had any kind of love for them. Yet we are the ones who don't understand.

couchpotatocarl,"Yes, this is where psychology comes in. But when it states something like depression or obesity or schizophrenia or psychopathy is 'condition' it is absolute nonsense. It is almost always an effect of biology, horrific/positive past experiences, social conditions, or a chemical imbalance. The only reason it is stated as an isolated condition is to push medication for consumers and this is where I, and a few others say hogwash. That being said, psychology is extremely useful when used to ask those important questions, and answer them in the correct way. When we understand dreams/how babies think etc, I guarantee it will boil down to biological or chemical terms, ie how neurons fire, the pathways they go down, how those pathways are created and why etc. There is a lot more to know about the human brain, psychology asks the right questions and uses other sciences to answer. This is how it should be used, as a bridge between sciences.

To put it into perspective google street scenes from any decade prior to the 90's and the hammies will be few and far between.  Again, unless there was a massive mutation of the human genome from then to now the only explanation is behavioral.

DreadlordCherryCake,"OH my fucking god. I love how the general sentiment here is comparing the statements of middle schoolers to that of a parent. A parent defines how you view the world. They are an inextricable part of your reality. At a super young age they are basically god. They are the only sense you have of what you are supposed to be treated like. As you grow up they still have that same emotional power until your identity is settled enough to be able to realize they are imperfect. Middle schoolers can say hurtful shit, of course, but they are peers. They are not your caretaker, they are not intrinsic to your worldview the same way a parent has the power to be. I agree it is in her mother's AND father's power to build not only a healthy self image but a healthy body, but having someone else outside of their family unit insult her is hardly an acceptable way to do this. I call bullshit on the dad's behavior. He isn't an outsider in the situation. He is a parent, and it's his job to protect/help his kid. If her weight legitimately is not due to age/hormones and she's teetering towards obesity, agreeing with some asshole friend is hardly the way to really invest himself in helping her get healthy.

autoNFA,Every inch of you is perfect strongly implies that your weight isn't a factor in your dating success and satisfaction. I'm not talking about the mildly overweight people here. I agree that a lot of people wouldn't see a difference in their dating success if they went from mildly overweight to medium weight. I'm talking about the significantly overweight to obese people. Those people will see their dating options significantly curtailed by being seriously overweight. Large amounts of excess weight are unattractive to the vast majority of people for biologically objective reasons  there's a whole host of major health risks associated with obesity.

Heart disease is a major killer now and considering how the disease process happens likely was long ago as well. If you didn't die of infection first...or trauma.

In many primitive hunter-gatherer societies, the averga age of menarche (first period) is 16-17 years. I think that says something.
