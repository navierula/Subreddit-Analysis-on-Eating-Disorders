hrocson,"Feminism.  I thought it was all bra-burning man-hating stuff.  Those are the extremists, a minimal portion of the group who screams the loudest.  In reality, feminism looks at many important issues from all over the globe.

These are some of the issues I looked at in my Women's Studies 101:

* Stereotypes further women’s oppression seemingly innocently by seriously limiting worldviews (a WST course can seriously broaden it)

* The Wage Gap is one of the most infuriating, elusive, and oppressive institutions in place in America right now 

* Pop Culture and how it affects all women,
Body image, anorexia, expectations

* Female Genital Mutilation and the culture surrounding it is the ultimate real life example of male domination,
Domestic Violence is a close second

* Global issues abound – marriage customs, property ownership, government, sex slavery

""If you went there you could go to a place called school where you and about 30 other children would be told stories from all around the world, reading, writing, math.""

He shivered and pulled himself into a ball. I looked over him, he looked ruined, covered in scars and like a poster child for anorexia awareness. I wrapped my arms around him.

""Every day you could eat three meals throughout the day. No worrying about irradiation or sickness or even hunting."" He didn't react, he always went wide eyed when I mentioned that part. I clung even harder to him.

You might think she's able to be with you, but until she's a whole person she cannot offer herself to you no matter what she says or feels.  She can go through the motions, she can act for you, but if she's as wounded as you say she's not prepared to live with you and you will find that out over months and months of very painful attrition. 

Her eating disorder further complicates this. The success rate of treating these meaningfully outside of institutionalizing the sufferer is not promising. Anorexia kills nearly 20% of its victims.

Golden-Fox,"Freshman year of highschool I was very much in love with my best friend's sister. They were in a different school district, so I didn't see either of them too much. I liked his sister so much though, that I would go to hang out with him in the hopes that she would also be home and we'd be able to talk a bit. 

We had known each other our whole lives, she's only a year younger than me. We spent plenty of time together as kids and I did have a bit of a crush on her but as time went on I liked her more and was able to spend time with her less. We got along very well, though I never perceived anything more than just friendliness between us.

By the summer between my freshman and sophomore years, I was head over heels. Every love song was about here, every romance in every movie was us. That July she told me that she loved me. I told her that I loved her too. I must've looked like a cartoon character, my heart beating out of my chest.

That day she left for camp. I don't think I saw her for the rest of the summer. Once she got back I saw her even less than I did before. Camp hadn't gone well. She struggled with anorexia, though she was already very thin. She couldn't love me- she didn't even love herself. 

My heart was not broken. Heart break is sudden, like the snapping of a twig. My heart disintegrated slowly and over time.

I still see her, less than once a year. She's had plenty of boyfriends, none of them have been me. Eventually she came to tell me that she loves me like a brother.

paperclip1213,"**TL;DR bullied because of my weight by my brother-in-law even though I've lost all the weight thanks to the eating disorder which he kept pushing to worsen. He told me and my sister he was doing it for my own good. I came to my senses and realised that he's nothing more than a bully. 4 years later, she's still under his spell, my relationship with her is ruined, thus my relationship with my family is ruined. I got told that I'm the reason for my family being so depressed. If my dick brother in law hadn't done this to me I wouldn't be such a burden on their happiness.**

I have deep seated issues. (If you look at my post history, you might be able to get an idea of how bad these issues might be.)

A lot of my issues are to do with my weight. Looong story short, I was overweight until I turned 16. In March 2011 I developed anorexia (diagnosed as EDNOS because I still got my periods and was at normal on the BMI) and exercise addiction. Slowly I started losing the weight. In May that year my sister started having wedding talks as she was having an arranged marriage. We found my now brother-in-law who we loved because he was great company. At least, this is what we thought until he became a little too comfortable taking out his superiority issues on me. From day 1 of meeting the guy he would make comments on my weight, what I was eating, how I looked fat, etc., etc. He was overweight and insecure so he took it out on me.

Fast forward to autumn that year (a few months after they marry) and she tries to tell him on more than one occasion to stop making those comments. He starts telling her that he's doing it to make me a stronger person because I'm ""too sensitive"". He says I need to learn to take a joke. He says he's doing it for my own good. She sells me this bullshit and I actually believe it. What other choice do I have? I'm 16, my sister is the only person I've ever looked to for guidance, she's the one who has all the answers I need, and ultimately I trust her. She actually said ""he loves you and he just wants what's best for you."" Now, almost 4 years later, it dawns on me that it's impossible to love your punching bag.

December comes and those comments don't stop. Each comment becomes more and more tedious and more and more ridiculous. Doesn't the guy get bored? I mean, seriously, in May it will have been 4 years since we met him and I can bet on my life that he will not have stopped by then. Anyway, going back to December 2011, the comments don't stop and I start getting pissed off and just generally more sensitive. At this point they both have found out that I have an eating disorder, yet still he continues saying what he would say.

Slloooowwly over the next few months I start realise what a dickhead he really is. He doesn't want me to be a stronger person. He doesn't want me to be less sensitive. Those are bullshit excuses he uses to manipulate us into letting him bully me. He's your classic bully. This 30 year old man is so insecure about himself that he has to take it out on a 16 year old girl because there's no weaker target around.

Fast forward to December 2014, specifically Christmas day and I'm having a breakdown in my sister's car about life in general. I haven't done this in well over 4 years. She tells me that I've changed and that I'm a stronger person compared to who I was when I was 16. She tells me it's thanks to my brother-in-law for making me this way. For the first time since my realisation 3 years ago, I tell her that he's manipulated her into believing that bullying me is good for me. You know what she says? ""Bullying is good for you. It made you a stronger person!"" I say ""well then why do I feel weaker?!"" She tells me that when I was 16 I was crazy emotional and she was scared that I'd self-harm or slit my wrists or something. She has no idea that before I met the guy I didn't self-harm at all. I only started self-harming  after they married. I don't mean to say that he's the main trigger for my self-harm, but if he had never started bullying me than my eating disorder wouldn't be as bad as it is now and my mental health wouldn't have deteriorated so much. The reason I feel so weak today is because he stole my sister's faith in me and replaced it with the belief that she has to have faith in him bullying me because that's what it takes to make me a stronger person. Even she's joined in on the bullying. I can't stand her for doing that. I know it's not her fault because manipulators be manipulators, and she's just the victim of one, but I wish she'd just listen to me and stop it because it has made me start resenting her which is in turn making her resent me. Now we're in this resentful loop and our entire family's being dragged into it because now all of them hate me. My other sister actually said to me today ""you're the reason we're all so depressed"".

hjlr,"Hi. I realise this post Is quite old now but I'm going to reply in case you're still in the same position or in case anyone else reading your question is. 

I've suffered from depression, anorexia and anxiety so I feel like I might be qualified enough to help you out. When you're stressed, like you are at school, your body is in the fight or flight mode. It thinks at any moment it's going to need to fight for your life so of course food doesn't rate high in its priorities. That's why you're not eating and have no appetite at school. All of this anxiety wears you down so quickly and with you not getting much sleep you're having no time to recover. The winters especially so difficult because the days are short and dark, the weathers fighting you and all you want to do is rest! 

My advice would be to start with the issue of anxiety and depression and watch everything else fall into place. Look for a counsellor at your school I've had counselling and it helped so much. Would you know who at your school you could turn to to ask about the availability of counsellors?

 I also took SSRIs as prescribed by a doctor but they're not for everyone and it depends on your age. 

As for eating that's difficult. I used to eat dry cereal, just a handful for breakfast. The important thing is to eat whatever you'd like but make sure it's not junk, good food will nourish you and immediately help in the fight to get you back on the right track! 

In the evening after school make sure you eat enough fruit and vegetables as well. One philosopher once said ""let food be thy medicines and medicine be thy food"" and that's true in your case. Focus on nourishing yourself and not merely just surviving. 

This is my first visit to this sub and no ones received comments to their questions so I thought I'd help where I felt I could. I hope you're well and looking after yourself. 

TLDR. 
FIND A COUNSELLOR AT SCHOOL.

&gt;__Russell's sign__ named after British psychiatrist [Gerald Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Russell) is a [sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(medical\))  defined as [calluses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calluses) on the [knuckles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuckles)  or back of the hand due to repeated self-induced [vomiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting) over long periods of time. The condition generally arises from the afflicted's knuckles making contact with the [incisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor) teeth during the act of inducing the [gag reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_reflex) at the back of the [throat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat) with their finger(s).

&gt;This type of scarring is considered one of the physical indicators of a [mental illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_illness), and Russell's sign is primarily found in patients with an [eating disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder) such as [bulimia nervosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulimia_nervosa) or [anorexia nervosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa). However, it is not always a reliable indicator of an eating disorder.

&gt;Bulimics who are capable of ""handsfree purging"", or the induction of vomiting by the willful opening of the esophageal sphincter in a manner similar to belching, while contracting the stomach muscles, do not have Russell's sign.

VibratingColors,"Nicole knew the second she walked through the door that she would be found out.

She had hoped that the stereotype surrounding the werewolf physique was false or at least somewhat exaggerated--surely, there was no way that *every* werewolf was tall, muscular, and broad-featured...right?  But if there was an exception to this rule, it was not to be found in the small meeting room before her; of the fifteen-or-so other people in the room, all were towering in height and built like classical Greek sculptures. She, at a mere four-foot-eleven inches and with all the muscle definition of a stuffed animal with its stuffing torn out, looked like a child next in comparison. 

She had an excuse ready for not being able to shift, if she were prompted to do so--every time she had shifted in front of her father, she was kicked harshly, beaten with a silver-buckled belt, and had her life threatened, the story would go, so shifting was now psychologically traumatizing to the point that she would have a severe panic attack if she were to attempt to shift, especially in front of other people. But she didn't have anything planned for the inevitable, ""Well, if you're a werewolf, then why are you so...tiny?"" 

*""Maybe I can tell them that I have a rare form of lycanthropic dwarfism?""* she thought. But *were* there are werewolves with dwarfism? And what if they asked her what type of dwarfism--human dwarfs, for example, could have primordial dwarfism, achondroplasia, or the many other types of dwarfism that did not immediately come to Nicole's mind, but she didn't know if werewolves could have any of those types of dwarfism, and she surely didn't know the names of any lycanthropic-specific types of dwarfism. 

*""Maybe I could pretend that I'm eleven?""* Surely, werewolf *children* couldn't be that ripped or tall, and maybe she could claim to have neglectful parents that didn't provide her with adequate nutrition, thus stunting her growth...but then it had been eleven years since she, herself, was an eleven-year-old in age, and she did not happen to be terribly close with any lycanthropic tweens, now or then...

Maybe she could use the ""malnourished"" excuse in the absence of being a child? Would a werewolf who was not well-feed in childhood and who was now struggling with anorexia look like she did?

A man (or perhaps manly-looking teen?) approached her. ""So...you a runt or a hunt?""

""What did I tell you about making accusations, Tanu?"" another man(ly looking teen?) boomed from across the room. ""This is a place of respect and acceptance and not of judgment.""

""Idunno, Kale--she sure does look...not wolfish,"" a woman standing to the left of Tanu replied. ""You can see it in her face. Remember the last time we let a hunter into the group? Poor Hina remembers, don't you?""

A woman with an eyepatch over her left eye sighed. 

""Yeah, like Thumbelina here could hunt *anything,* let alone *us*,"" another group member snorted. ""She's either a runt or, Idunno, a really confused human, and...huh, Idunno...she has a look about her that you don't usually see in humans, but she don't have that werewolf look, either...""

""Well, I've seen her around campus, and I think she might be in the right place,"" said a girl that Nicole suddenly realized she somewhat knew. The girl's name was Nuri, and she was in her American Folklore class this semester. 

It was in that class that Nicole stabbed a pencil into her arm and then proceeded to snap said pencil in half over receiving an 84 on an exam. Nicole was prone to self-injury when upset; a therapist once told her that she might be on the autistic spectrum, but the counselor on campus disagreed; apparently, her social skills were ""not clinically impaired."" Nicole, like many young people whose psychological professionals don't reach a consensus on, has taken to Dr. Google to figure out why she had such poor emotional control and why she couldn't tolerate loud noises or chaotic environments and why she had a tendency to pace and fidget and otherwise be ""annoyingly hyperactive""; she had looked over many terms, like Asperger's, Non-verbal Learning Disorder, ADHD, hyperlexia, but none of them truly seemed to jive. Within any searches for childhoods disorders, of course, brought the clause, ""Many of these symptoms are also present in lycanthropic children without behavioral or learning disabilities."" She hadn't originally considered lycanthropy for herself, due to the obvious fact that neither she or anyone else in her entire family could shift into a wolf form, but she did recall being asked a few times throughout both her childhood and her college career if she were a werewolf, and it was only about a month ago that her American Folklore professor slipped her a flyer with the information for this very support group with an attached sticky note that said, ""This could help."" Although she lacked the whole ""turning into a wolf thing"" and, apparently, the ""werewolf look,"" there was something about lycanthropy that seemed to jive better than, say, autism or ADHD. She, like werewolves, was hypersensitive to auditory and tactile stimuli but hyposensitive to heat; she, like werewolves, was prone to fidgeting and the occasional non-cutting self-injury; she, like werewolves, preferred the company of animals and nature to humans; she, like werewolves, felt a sense of being ""not like the others,"" and years of being called a ""werido"" and a ""freak"" seemed to agree with this assessment. She even had a slight aversion to silver jewelry...although her skin didn't like nickle, either, and it was probably the nickle and not the silver that she was reacting to. 

Nicole had once considered the possibility that she was actually a werewolf that had some rare genetic mutation that made her unable to shift; she had spent her birthday money last year on an at-home DNA testing kit that, while too cheap and inefficient to detect *every* gene that a person may have, could most certainly pick up on the 24th chromosome that existed only in werewolves or the possible translocation of the genetic material on this chromosome to other chromosomes. Her results, however, had shown that she had exactly no genes that would cause her to be lycanthropic. 

She knew that it'd be foolish to show up at a Werewolf College Student Support Group, being that, well, she wasn't a werewolf, she really did, but...she had hoped that there'd be 4'11'', scrawny, kiddish-looking werewolves and that she wouldn't look so out of place...she had hoped that she could talk about how the self-injury just *happened* and how she didn't premeditate to ""get attention,"" how the world was just too much, too loud, how her body wouldn't let her be as still for as long as she was supposed to be, and be understood for just *once* in her lifetime. She had hoped that she could make friends that would empathize with her instead of pick on her. She had hoped that, just this one time, she could feel like she *belonged,* that she actually, truly, belonged.

But the questioning looks that the werewolves shot at her told her that this would not be that time or place.

""Well, I'm a runt, alright...but I'm no wolf.""

Nicole buried her face in her hands. One of her fatal flaws, besides, well, everything, was that she could sometimes craft pretty convincing lies in her head, but she couldn't execute them, or at least couldn't execute them well; when she didn't wind up just spilling out the truth, she'd tend to chuckle and look down in a way that make the falsehood immediately apparent. 

""I'm...I'm so sorry for wasting your time...""

Her hands began to itch from being tickled with tears.

""Hey, hey, don't cry..."" Kale said tenderly while putting a hand on her shoulder. ""We're twenty-somethings--we waste time all the time. I hope you don't think that we can turn you, do you?""

Nicole shook her head ""no."" Some humans (and perhaps some werewolves, too) still believed that lycanthropy could be transferred through bites or saliva (or even breath, according to some of the elder, more superstitious humans), but it had long been proven that lycanthropy was solely genetic in nature--it was rabies, not the ability to turn into a wolf, that was spread in all the legends of humans being ""turned."" The ability to transfer the material on the 24th chromosome was one that even the most advanced geneticists were still struggling with (besides, it was thought that lycanthropy also had some of its genetic roots in the 8th and 10th chromosome, though which genes in particular, scientists didn't yet understand). Supposedly, they've done it with a few humans, but most seemed to think that it was a hoax. 

Nicole didn't know if it was or wasn't a hoax, but she knew that no one around here could turn her into a different species, if such a thing was possible at all.""  

Nicole noticed that she had began to rock back-and-forth as she sometimes did when she was upset; she froze with a force that made her dizzy. 

""I'm just a weird human, and I...I thought that I'd feel less weird with you guys...""

Tanu scoffed. ""Idunno--we're pretty weird, and we tend to weird even ourselves out..."" 

Kale pat Nicole on the back. ""Tell ya' what; you seem harmless enough, and we have plenty of room in here. You can stay if you want to--just don't pull any silver out on us, okay? There's beef jerky and cookies behind the counter, if you want some. There's also brownies, but the brownies have a tendency to be...hashed."" A few people snickered. ""Welcome to our group. We don't bite....people. Not often, at least."" ",WritingPrompts,t5_2s3nb,5
going_bananas,"I am at a similar point now. I've struggled with anorexia for 6 years ans am physically recovered. This does not mean that you got over it mentally, this is the most important point. And reading what you wrote it seems to me that you are aware of that fact.
An eating disorder is not something that can be 100% cured with pills. It will always be a bigger or smaller part of your life, it may fade and come back again, especially in times when you are stressed about other stuff.
I can only tell you my opinion and experience with this but i really hope it will help you and your gf a little bit.
There are days or weeks or months where she won't feel comsortable at all in her own skin. And you won't be able to do anything really about it. Just treat her like always, if she is okay with cuddling and stuff do it, but stop if she tells you so. I have days when i don't want to be touched by anyone and even wearing jeans is a very big deal then.
Also be careful with jokes about her body and weight and so on. Maybe she does not care sometimes but especially when you struggle one false word can hurt like hell even if you didn't mean it.
But the most important point - at least for me - has always been that i can talk to my bf whenever i want. You do not necessarily have to give advice or something. Just listen to her. You might not always understand what she means - and you are not supposed to, you're lucky that you don't - but ler her talk, let her cry and just be there to listen.

The film attempts to stare down social issues such as video game culture, anorexia, infidelity, fame hunting, and the proliferation of illicit material on the internet. As each character and each relationship is tested, we are shown the variety of roads people choose - some tragic, some hopeful - as it becomes clear that no one is immune to this enormous social change that has come through our phones, our tablets, and our computers.

Flintlox,"&gt;To be fair I wouldn't want someone with a severe mental issue to own a firearm...

What's severe and who defines it? Our current anti-gun surgeon general? A congress that doesn't understand the difference between a clip and a magazine, much less complex mental diagnoses? You're opening a Pandora's box with vague statements like that.

Mental issues range from something you might find trivial like RLS and anorexia to deranged psychosis. It's easy to say that you don't want someone with a severe mental disorder to own a firearm but it's a lot harder to write a law doesn't infringe on regular people's rights who are just looking for help.

All you're really going to do is prevent people who own guns from seeking professional help, that could enrich their lives.

It's also an open door for confiscation, as the above article and you, are pitching are a prelude to. Political dissident? Confiscated. Protester? Confiscated? Pro-constitution? Confiscated. This is exactly what they were trying to pull with the MIAC report, they just switch from domestic terrorist to delusional and voila you have a PC way to silence or disarm people that are politically inconvenient.

Do you know how many people suffer from depression and anxiety? Millions. Beyond that there are a shit ton of people who suffer from PTSD and similar mental issues that never hurt anyone. 

[Also something people don't realize is there is never really a diagnosis of ""psychopathy"" or ""sociopathy"" the diagnosis is typically anti social personality disorder and is VERY vague.](http://psychcentral.com/disorders/antisocial-personality-disorder-symptoms/) Thousands of people in the military are diagnosed with that every day, including several of my friends.

I've been told that anorexia occurs pretty frequently along side bipolar because of the effect that starvation and overexercising has in stabilizing our moods--not to mention creating a sense of control when we're stuck in shitty situations we can't escape from.

Also, if you want to read a really good book having to do mostly about Bipolar but also EDs, I'd read Madness by Marya Hornbacher--really good book, but sad as well.

What originally started out just as me thinking, ""I'm terrified of vomiting, so I am going to avoid putting food into my stomach"" eventually became that PLUS ""I feel so perfect/pure/strong when I don't eat and I love losing weight."" Starving myself triggered the old ED thoughts and made it harder for me to want to get help.

Edit: I also really did need to lose some weight, so that part was good at first. It only got serious after about 8-9 months when I began to be dizzy all the time from a lack of nutrition. I was also ridiculously busy with my last year of college when I was dealing with the phobia and didn't have time for treatment.

notgayinathreeway,"I can appreciate and understand both sides of the argument.

""You NEED to have faith or you will suffer in hell forever, I must force this on you for your own good"" very logical reasoning for someone you care about. To someone with that reasoning, a person without faith might be thought of in the same light as someone with bulimia who cannot see how they are suffering from malnourishment.

Alternatively, an atheist could feel the same way. ""There is no afterlife at all, no heaven to be rewarded with and the only hell is living with these restrictions in your life."" This could be in the same light as someone with anorexia.

The religious person, from the atheistic standpoint, refuses to nourish themselves by not partaking in life the way an atheist might, for fear of going to hell. Not that atheists all have a poor judgement when it comes to morality, but a lot of more formal religious people are very much missing out on living life to the fullest, especially in cultures outside of the USA. In this way they are identical to the anorexic person. They're starving this life for something that will not help them in the end.

But the atheist, who obviously might be seen as a sinner, embracing the aspects of life a religious person feels they should not, would be seen as the bulimic. They take in all of this junk they do not need, but do not get the proper nourishment from it as they do not allow the prosperity of god to stay within them. Sure, they might be living, perhaps too extravagantly, but they're just going to throw it all away in the end.

WhitNit87,"Hi, as a recovered bulimic, I first want to say how wonderful it is that you are seeking advice for how to help YOU help HER. My question for you is how did you find out? Did you catch her? Have you suspected it? Did she just tell you?
 The first step I would suggest would be to research bulimia as well as you can. The second, and this could be hard for you to stomach, would be to go on a pro Ana/Mia (pro anorexia/bulimia) website and get in the minds of bulimics. I know your gf is telling you how she is feeling, but it can show you the extent of those ""fat"" and ""afraid to lose a pound"" thoughts she has. 
She will most likely fall off the wagon and throw up again. If she does, (if she truly wants to quit) this will frustrate her so much. Just make sure she knows you are still there for her and let her know how proud you are of her going X amount of days without purging. 
If it gets to hard, there is rehab, but a lot of girls quit without the need of rehab. Usually (but not all the time) rehab is full of girls and guys that don't want to quit (I mean they aren't 100% committed to it).

nlaq1,"&gt; I see repeatedly in tumblr posts from FAers that eating disorders will be solved once societies standards change about how women should look.

I don't believe so. I don't suffer from anorexia or bulimia, and I often try to understand those kinds of conditions and why it is that people have them.

I do, however, suffer from moderate to severe depression and anxiety. And I see a lot of parallels. While I can't exactly relate to an ED, it's easy for me to understand a disproportionate lack of self worth. To look back on whatever (be it your weight, your accomplishments, your friends and family), and still feel empty, alone, miserable and worthless. To me it seems like ED's may have a similar thread: where a person's ability to measure themselves objectively is impaired and causes self destructive behavior.

These days there is a lot of pressure on women to look a certain way, less so than men. Being a dude, I never felt a massive amount of anxiety or guilt about my weight. Instead, I found other things to feel shit about. And I did. A lot. And still do. And I don't think it will ever go away.

So, no, I don't think that changing society's standards can fix a broken self image. I believe (though could be wrong) that it is a fundamental, deep rooted issue that goes beyond the specifics.

That being said: not all women, nor men, will be supermodels. There is truth to finding a way to live with yourself regardless of your weight. As long as your weight isn't self destructive or harmful. At /r/fatlogic we are completely against people doing harm to themselves and the delusions that come with that. And it is absolute fact that being fat is harmful and self-destructive. As is having an ED that causes you to not be able to sustain your body's functions anymore. Neither extreme is acceptable.

Fat people are not attractive because they don't care about themselves. Emaciated people are not attractive because they don't care about themselves. There is an objective middle ground. Being healthy and confident gives you a leg up on almost any circumstance.

If your ED remains untreated, you're doing yourself no more service than the FA's who delude their followers into maintaining a dangerous fat percentage. You need to find the root of the issue and correct it. But it may have nothing to do with supermodels or society: it may have to do with something even deeper.",fatlogic,t5_2wyxm,5

Not of what it looked like, but what it was doing for me and for my daughter. I felt strong. Of course, I had bad days, but for the most part I was just overwhelmed with respect for my body.

WarmFishSalad,"&gt;It's measurable in the fact that we have a much more complete understanding of the process of human development. Examining fossil records is much less precise because we do not have a complete record of the events of the world. Measuring strata is probably the best method we have, but can be disrupted by large effects like volcanic eruptions. That's my point. I could be wrong, but the number given by the doctor in question (looked up but can't remember the guys name) seems incredibly high. Especially since I found a much lower number from the UCSF.

Im not a scientist.  Im just an old man.  A simple man.  But i do have doctors in the family.  So i know a bit
  I also have a friend with anorexia.  She cant have kids.  Apparently there arent enough calories in her system to sustain a baby so the body stops making eggs.  Apparently this is common with athletes with very low body fat counts.

The reason i mention this is because human biology is rather messy.  We do know how pregnancy works, but we dont know at which rate all women get pregnant, experience difficulties with pregnency or anything else.

So...bad science?


&gt;I brought up abortion because it is the direct consequence of this discussion. If life does not begin at conception, abortion is not moral, and we Christians are wrong.

Abortion is a choice.  If fertilized eggs are dumped naturally by the human body.  No choice made.  The design created by the creator, by either evolution or direct creation, is intentional.  Are all women baby killers by proxy?  If you think life begins at conception...then yes.  Another idea made up with no basis.  

Did you know that Thomas Aquinas didnt believe that babies had souls at conception?  Probably not.  The reason why is because there were various ideas and no one could quiet agree.  The bible says nothing.

&gt;Far from saying this can't be whittled down to the problem of evil in your last post, you stated it quite plainly. ""Why would God design the female body to kill a vast majority of the humans it creates?"" Explain to me how that is not questioning either the existence of God or his all-loving nature? 

Because he can exist and be loving...and be wrong.  Either be not omnipotent or be not omniscent.  There is an obvious illogicality i have highlighted here, and i feel no one can claim that it is a result of sin.

&gt;
If you don't want to discuss the problem of evil, that's fine with me. I just see no other way to proceed with this discussion without tackling that issue.

I do.  Its called...considering my question and trying to answer it.  My guess is that you prefer to move to an area you can debate rather than just recognize the problem here.  The CHURCH made a boo boo.  They shouldnt pretend to know shif they dont.  They shouldnt lie.  It gets people killes.

Sativa Halappanavar...for as long as i live ans breath...ill fight this.

&gt;You started the post with how many think this is a trick question. Most trick questions are either loaded or utilize an oversimplification of a larger issue. The larger issue of the trick question you began this debate with is the problem of evil.

The problem of evil has a simple solution.  Its called ""they deserved it."".  Since the beginning of the religion you will find people who presume that when bad crap happened they deserved if.  After all, why would a good god punish a good person (its not like he buggered around with Job or anything).

Infant dies in a crib?  Parents sinned.  Church gets hit by lightening?  Musta been heretics.  The answer is obvious to some.

Others disagree.  They think that innocent people suffer and wonder why?  Well, you can use the former logic to explain why.  Thats the point.  You cannot say that baby deserved to.get flushed without condeming all of the sex having women as sinners.

ladybug588,"Hi friend, I just want to start by saying that I understand where you are. I'm a girl and I think you're a boy (sorry if I'm wrong) and I think that gives you an even harder fight because people tend to associate anorexia with females. High school is rough, it's an image game and your peers are just as concerned with how they look.

What hobbies do you have? Do you have a favorite subject or a passion for a certain field? If you do, focus on developing that. If you don't, do some research and soul searching and try to find something. It's OK if you don't, that's normal at your age. 

With regards to your health, is there someone you can reach out to? Have you considered a dietician or therapy? People will be attracted to you if you're healthy, body and mind.

heirplane,"Eating disorders became popular:

&gt;Anorexia nervosa continued to rapidly increase into the next decade and became known as the “disorder of the 80s,” suggesting that diseases, particularly psychiatric disorders, are often directly linked to cultural contexts (though some aspects of anorexia exhibits both noncultural and cultural incidences). By the mid 1980s, college campuses instituted counseling or support systems, and public awareness reached a peak when popular singer Karen Carpenter died of cardiac arrest.

When asked why eating those foods made them anxious, they DIDN'T say things like, ""This cupcake will make me fat,"" but rather things like, ""I'm afraid if I take one bite, I won't be able to stop.""

hollywoodshowbox,"So, I had my own mentor and I mentor a few young adults now that I've recovered. Here's what helped me: 

* Can they relate to your story? I typically work best with YAs who displayed characteristics of anorexia or bulimia but maybe were never medically diagnosed (for whatever reason). I can't relate as well to the kids who were grossly underweight and spent a lot of time as in-patients. I can certainly help them! But I know others who could help them *better*, and we're trying to find ways to help you best. 

* Reasonable access. I couldn't reach my mentor 24/7 because that's a lot to ask of one person, but I had a few set hours each day that my mentor would be available to me. Similarly, I'm available to each of my mentees (sp?) and they all know that I'll get back to them within a certain number of hours no matter how busy I am. 

* A tailored long-term plan. So, so important I can't emphasize this enough. You and your mentor need to figure out together what works for you. Do you need to be checked in on daily, or do you do better with more freedom but need a more thorough, weekly check-in? How many and what kinds of phases will you work through? While recovery never really has a definitive ""end-point"", there needs to be some kind of conclusion. You obviously can't be checking in with your mentor for the next 25 years, so make sure that hitting recovery and achieving independence are included in your plan. This includes goals and motivations for sticking with your plan. Maybe your big dream is to go to grad school, and getting better is just one of the necessary prerequisites of making it there. 

* An emergency plan. What if you feel the sudden need to purge or restrict? What are you going to do? Your mentor should be able to help you lay out a plan (either a step-by-step plan, or one that gives you a variety of things to do) even when they aren't available to help you at 2AM.

Secondly, ED's are more than just Anorexia and Bulimia - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) lists the full range of disorders, which include EDNOS (eating disorder not otherwise specified) and BINGE EATING DISORDER. Furthermore, something that society at large overlooks is that if you looked at sufferers of the entire range of eating disorders, most are of average or above average weight. 

There are more bulimics than anorexics, and bulimics are statistically more likely to be of average or above average weight - similar with EDNOS. Binge eating disorder involves a very high rate of obesity. The underweight ED sufferer represents a much smaller proportion of EDs than most people assume.

It might depend on the type of razor you use.  You can tell that I shave, but I use a cheap disposable razor.  Whether it's patchy or not depends on your genetics.  It can take a while for a real beard to grow in- even cis males might not be able to grow a good beard until they're in their mid twenties.  So you might have to be on T for a while.

Yes T will make leg hair thicker.  (And thigh, arms, toes and everywhere else.)  Can't say I really noticed any change in pit hair but.. it's not like I check it.

T can give you a receding hairline and baldness if you have the genetics for it.  I have heard that your hair can become more coarse, can't say I really pay attention to that kind of detail.

&gt;For those who have taken T, what didn't you liek about it? What did you liek most about it? What things surprised you? and what is your opinion on it? What sort of thing should i be prepared for? What long term effects does it have?

My favorite thing about T is my added strength and endurance.  Fat redistribution has been very nice too.  My least favorite is the lessening of empathy, love, and other emotions.  It's the worst part of being male but I can deal with it.  I don't think anything has been a surprise because I'd spent so many years researching beforehand.  Maybe I'm surprised by how easy it is to inject myself with a giant needle- something I never thought I'd be capable of.  Most of T's effects are permanent, read that document I linked.

&gt;Also I've been struggling with anorexia so can malnourishment (mild or severe) play a roll in how my T works? Should I wait to do T until after I'm fully recovered or should i start now? because i hear teh earlier you start it, the better results you get.

I am not a doctor, but I imagine being malnourished effects your bodies ability to do anything efficiently.  Your metabolism increases on T meaning you'll feel hungrier, have more energy, but also put on more weight if you don't work out.  If you are malnourished you're not going to be able to build muscle effectively.  I think it's possible to work on both problems at the same time.

&gt;Also if I don't want to fully look liek a guy, does playing around with the dosages work? I'm bigendered and i enjoy having boobs and a vagina and all that, but on occassion i don't. I also want to be able to experience broader shoulders, a deeper voice and all the perks of T but not at a huge extent. Is this possible?

Not really.  You cannot pick and choose which changes will happen on T- all the changes will come eventually, but being a low dose just means they will come slowly.  If you are on a low dose you won't experience as much muscle gain or fat redistribution, so you probably won't have a very male body shape.  If you like your female body you should think long and hard about if T is really right for you.

Edit: Some genderqueer people use T for a while until they masculinize a bit, and then stop when they have an androgynous appearance.  Facial hair, voice, and some of the changes to your face will be permanent.  Fat and muscle is not permanent so will revert to female if you stop taking T.",asktransgender,t5_2r4b9,2
kjcl222,"&gt; A person with an ED is trying to live up to THEIR expectation before anyone else's, and they happen to be distorted.

This exactly. I've had anorexia for about 4 years now, and it was always about MY goals. It wasn't even about looks or being attractive to society. I didn't care about what anyone thought I looked like. I cared about being up to my standard of thinness, which was informed by my depression and dissatisfaction in other parts of my life. I carry around a lot of guilt, so my desire to be thin is a desire to look like I'm punishing myself (for a WHOLE lot of things). Another part of it was denying my sexuality, which meant becoming unattractive. Being 87 lb, with sallow, yellow skin and hair that's falling out, plus that neat white hair that grows is not beautiful. No one wants that- but I do because I'm disordered. ",fatlogic,t5_2wyxm,5
rafblk,"&gt; I just can't help feel like I'd be a freak-show if I started growing facial hair. Like a bearded woman.

T changes a lot more about your face than just facial hair. the texture of your skin changes, your hairline changes, your face looks more angular as you lose fat... if you've gotten to the point where you have noticeable facial hair, you'll probably be masculine enough in other ways such that you won't look like a bearded woman.

&gt; If I did shave everyday would people be able to tell that I do grow facial hair?

like with cis men, this varies from person to person and depends on things like hair color, hair thickness, hair growth rate, etc.

&gt; Also, say in the future i decided to grow facial hair would it ever be nice and consistent or would it always kind of be patchy?

again, like with cis men, this varies from person to person and is largely dependent on genetics. many trans men are able to grow wonderful full beards, but many are not able to grow anything but fuzz. no one can answer questions about how your hair will grow in because it's different for everyone, cis and trans.

&gt; Does T make leg hair and pit hair thicker?

for most people, yes.

&gt; Would it change anything about the hair on the top of my head

for people who are genetically predisposed to it, T might induce male-pattern baldness, hair thinning, or a receding hairline. but, again, this is different for everyone.

&gt; What exactly can/does T do? If any of you guys (or all of you guys together, i don't know) could write a list of all of the stuff you guys now T does/can do I would appreciate it so much.

there's a lot. start [here](http://www.ftmguide.org/ttherapybasics.html) maybe; the [WPATH standards of care](http://admin.associationsonline.com/uploaded_files/140/files/Standards%20of%20Care,%20V7%20Full%20Book.pdf) are also a good resource.

&gt; For those who have taken T, what didn't you liek about it? What did you liek most about it? 

i've loved every single thing T has done for me. there is literally not one thing i dislike about it (i was lucky and didn't get any acne, though). my favorite changes have been my increased muscle mass and body hair.

&gt; What things surprised you? 

i was surprised at how much and how quickly my musculature changed. i mean, i was expecting to gain muscle mass, but i didn't expect it to be so much or so fast. other than that i haven't been surprised by anything because i went into hormones very educated about what to expect.

&gt; What sort of thing should i be prepared for? What long term effects does it have?

read the stuff i linked above for info on long-term effects.

&gt; Also I've been struggling with anorexia so can malnourishment (mild or severe) play a roll in how my T works?

probably not, but T does effect metabolism and eating habits; i'd be more concerned about T effecting your anorexia than the other way around. this is definitely something you need to talk to a doctor about.

&gt; because i hear teh earlier you start it, the better results you get.

this is a myth.

&gt; I also want to be able to experience broader shoulders, a deeper voice and all the perks of T but not at a huge extent. Is this possible?

hormones are fuzzy. you do not get to pick and choose what happens to you or to what extent. sometimes nonbinary people go on low-dose T for a slower or less dramatic transition, but from what i can gather this doesn't really prevent things from happening so much as it stretches the timeline of changes out. i'm not an expert though: you might want to check out [Micah's blog](http://neutrois.me) for more information on transitioning with a low dose of T.",asktransgender,t5_2r4b9,5

but_the_nisha_call,"I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and am in recovery from anorexia. Eating disorder behaviors were always my coping mechanisms and not having them has been a struggle! Something that has helped me along the way is a part of the DBT model of therapy which involves Emotion Regulation skills, and also some Distress Tolerance. You can look these up and see if they help! Sometimes the skills seem so stupidly simple but clear your mind of judgment and give them a shot. 

A big tool in ED treatment centers is to keep an orange in the freezer. When you're starting to feel really amped up with anxiety or racing thoughts or feel a panic attack coming on, grab the orange and squeeze it in your hands. Temperature change can shock the body and actually help to calm you and change the focus of your mind. You can dig your nails into the orange as it thaws, and you also get the calming smell of citrus. Sounds totally kooky but it can be really effective! :)",raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,4

grumpyfat," There has been historical documentation of cases of anorexia and bulimia dating back hundreds (even thousands, I believe, but need to find my source before I say for sure) of years, long before there was any overwhelming cultural emphasis on beauty and thinness. It is estimated that only 2-5% of the U.S. population suffers from restrictive type eating disorders, and that it is a generous figure. I don't know this for sure, but I would imagine that those numbers don't differ too dramatically in populations of societies that don't subscribe to western ideals of beauty. I think that certainly our obsession with appearance contributes to, and can even be the main instigator of disordered eating habits, but not actual eating disorders. ",fatlogic,t5_2wyxm,1
YoungFolks,"&gt; If I did shave everyday would people be able to tell that I do grow facial hair? Also, say in the future i decided to grow facial hair would it ever be nice and consistent or would it always kind of be patchy?

Your face will likely masculinize a bit before the facial hair comes in, so you won't look like a bearded woman. You'll look more like a scruffy teenager. Daily, close shaves will likely hide facial hair growth, but people might be able to feel some stubble. Of course, this depends on your genetics, and how hairy your are, and what color your hair will be. Growth depends on genetics. Even cis guys sometimes have patchy facial hair, and it may take many years before they have full, even coverage.

&gt; Does T make leg hair and pit hair thicker? Would it change anything about the hair on the top of my head

Yeah, your leg and pit hair will probably increase in volume and be thicker and rougher to touch. Some guys say head hear also changes texture, but I haven't noticed that. Your hairline will change, and you may start balding, depending on genetics. There are prescription drugs you can take to prevent hair loss, though. 

&gt; What exactly can/does T do?

The /r/ftm [FAQ Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index), [Hudson's Guide](http://www.ftmguide.org/), and [this PDF guide](http://www.camh.ca/en/hospital/care_program_and_services/hospital_services/Documents/hormones-FTM.pdf) are all excellent resources that will tell you about what you can expect. 

&gt; For those who have taken T, what didn't you liek about it? 

I really hate the return of acne and oily face. 

&gt; What did you liek most about it?

My baseline mood is so much more positive now. I think I described it as not being able to be moody even if I tried. I usually get really low and melancholy in the winter, but this year there's none of that. Also, my voice finally sounds normal.

&gt; What things surprised you? and what is your opinion on it?

I was surprised by the change in my scent. When I sweat, I smell like stinky man, and my normal scent is more musky. I thought I'd hate it, but it was one of the things I missed most when I had to go off T for a month for insurance reasons.  

&gt; What sort of thing should i be prepared for? 

You're gonna be surprised. There's no definite answer for what changes you get, when, and to what degree, or how they affect you. A lot of people don't consider the non physical changes. I'm more easily irritated now. It's not ""roid rage"" or anything, but things that I used to be able to ignore or not let bother me, are more likely to bother me. You may not get the changes you want immediately, or they may not be all you were hoping for. Oh, and you're gonna be hungry. 

&gt; What long term effects does it have?

See the resources I linked above. 

&gt; Also I've been struggling with anorexia so can malnourishment (mild or severe) play a roll in how my T works? Should I wait to do T until after I'm fully recovered or should i start now? because i hear teh earlier you start it, the better results you get.

You should talk to your doc about this. T will likely increase your appetite, since the changes being worked in your body means you need more fuel. 

&gt; Also if I don't want to fully look liek a guy, does playing around with the dosages work? 

You can go on a low dose, and stop whenever you want to. The low dose just means the changes happen more slowly. But individual bodies react to T differently, so you might get quick and strong changes even with a low dose. That's why you should stay on top of your levels and work with your prescribing doc to get the right dosage. ",asktransgender,t5_2r4b9,1

girlorguythrowaway,"I'm bothered by the fact that minors are deemed to be legally responsible for crimes like murder once they are 16 and above. I remember this 12 year old kid was even charged for first degree murder. But that's probably a hyperbole... I think the crux anyways isn't even about the trans community influencing the young ones to  try to avoid puberty. The trans community wouldn't be bothered if the system isn't broken. 

I mean responsibility should be in the hands of a medical professional who should be consulted in the event of a warranted medical condition like GID. When parents resort to faith healing and then they screw up their child, the blood is in their hands. 

Like that case where this couple prayed to God to heal their child from pneumonia and guess what? Child died and parents convicted of manslaughter. 

Rules on mones need to be adjusted as well - according to some semblance on how puberty occurs. 18 for consent is this really arbitrary number for everything that is meaningless. Actually turns out it's not so random ... 18 is the age where you can get drafted and legally kill enemies as a soldier, that's why age of voting was lowered to fit that conundrum. Anyways the fact is puberty happens before 18 and for many people some effects of that are irreversible.

Transgender Surgery Isn't the Solution
A drastic physical change doesn't address underlying psycho-social troubles.

Dr. McHugh, former psychiatrist in chief at Johns Hopkins Hospital, is the author of ""Try to Remember: Psychiatry's Clash Over Meaning, Memory, and Mind"" (Dana Press, 2008).

The government and media alliance advancing the transgender cause has gone into overdrive in recent weeks. On May 30, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services review board ruled that Medicare can pay for the ""reassignment"" surgery sought by the transgendered—those who say that they don't identify with their biological sex. Earlier last month Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said that he was ""open"" to lifting a ban on transgender individuals serving in the military. Time magazine, seeing the trend, ran a cover story for its June 9 issue called ""The Transgender Tipping Point: America's next civil rights frontier.""

Yet policy makers and the media are doing no favors either to the public or the transgendered by treating their confusions as a right in need of defending rather than as a mental disorder that deserves understanding, treatment and prevention. This intensely felt sense of being transgendered constitutes a mental disorder in two respects. The first is that the idea of sex misalignment is simply mistaken—it does not correspond with physical reality. The second is that it can lead to grim psychological outcomes.

The transgendered suffer a disorder of ""assumption"" like those in other disorders familiar to psychiatrists. With the transgendered, the disordered assumption is that the individual differs from what seems given in nature—namely one's maleness or femaleness. Other kinds of disordered assumptions are held by those who suffer from anorexia and bulimia nervosa, where the assumption that departs from physical reality is the belief by the dangerously thin that they are overweight.

With body dysmorphic disorder, an often socially crippling condition, the individual is consumed by the assumption ""I'm ugly."" These disorders occur in subjects who have come to believe that some of their psycho-social conflicts or problems will be resolved if they can change the way that they appear to others. Such ideas work like ruling passions in their subjects' minds and tend to be accompanied by a solipsistic argument.

For the transgendered, this argument holds that one's feeling of ""gender"" is a conscious, subjective sense that, being in one's mind, cannot be questioned by others. The individual often seeks not just society's tolerance of this ""personal truth"" but affirmation of it. Here rests the support for ""transgender equality,"" the demands for government payment for medical and surgical treatments, and for access to all sex-based public roles and privileges.

With this argument, advocates for the transgendered have persuaded several states—including California, New Jersey and Massachusetts—to pass laws barring psychiatrists, even with parental permission, from striving to restore natural gender feelings to a transgender minor. That government can intrude into parents' rights to seek help in guiding their children indicates how powerful these advocates have become.

How to respond? Psychiatrists obviously must challenge the solipsistic concept that what is in the mind cannot be questioned. Disorders of consciousness, after all, represent psychiatry's domain; declaring them off-limits would eliminate the field. Many will recall how, in the 1990s, an accusation of parental sex abuse of children was deemed unquestionable by the solipsists of the ""recovered memory"" craze.

You won't hear it from those championing transgender equality, but controlled and follow-up studies reveal fundamental problems with this movement. When children who reported transgender feelings were tracked without medical or surgical treatment at both Vanderbilt University and London's Portman Clinic, 70%-80% of them spontaneously lost those feelings. Some 25% did have persisting feelings; what differentiates those individuals remains to be discerned.

We at Johns Hopkins University—which in the 1960s was the first American medical center to venture into ""sex-reassignment surgery""—launched a study in the 1970s comparing the outcomes of transgendered people who had the surgery with the outcomes of those who did not. Most of the surgically treated patients described themselves as ""satisfied"" by the results, but their subsequent psycho-social adjustments were no better than those who didn't have the surgery. And so at Hopkins we stopped doing sex-reassignment surgery, since producing a ""satisfied"" but still troubled patient seemed an inadequate reason for surgically amputating normal organs.

It now appears that our long-ago decision was a wise one. A 2011 study at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden produced the most illuminating results yet regarding the transgendered, evidence that should give advocates pause. The long-term study—up to 30 years—followed 324 people who had sex-reassignment surgery. The study revealed that beginning about 10 years after having the surgery, the transgendered began to experience increasing mental difficulties. Most shockingly, their suicide mortality rose almost 20-fold above the comparable nontransgender population. This disturbing result has as yet no explanation but probably reflects the growing sense of isolation reported by the aging transgendered after surgery. The high suicide rate certainly challenges the surgery prescription.

There are subgroups of the transgendered, and for none does ""reassignment"" seem apt. One group includes male prisoners like Pvt. Bradley Manning, the convicted national-security leaker who now wishes to be called Chelsea. Facing long sentences and the rigors of a men's prison, they have an obvious motive for wanting to change their sex and hence their prison. Given that they committed their crimes as males, they should be punished as such; after serving their time, they will be free to reconsider their gender.

Another subgroup consists of young men and women susceptible to suggestion from ""everything is normal"" sex education, amplified by Internet chat groups. These are the transgender subjects most like anorexia nervosa patients: They become persuaded that seeking a drastic physical change will banish their psycho-social problems. ""Diversity"" counselors in their schools, rather like cult leaders, may encourage these young people to distance themselves from their families and offer advice on rebutting arguments against having transgender surgery. Treatments here must begin with removing the young person from the suggestive environment and offering a counter-message in family therapy.

Then there is the subgroup of very young, often prepubescent children who notice distinct sex roles in the culture and, exploring how they fit in, begin imitating the opposite sex. Misguided doctors at medical centers including Boston's Children's Hospital have begun trying to treat this behavior by administering puberty-delaying hormones to render later sex-change surgeries less onerous—even though the drugs stunt the children's growth and risk causing sterility. Given that close to 80% of such children would abandon their confusion and grow naturally into adult life if untreated, these medical interventions come close to child abuse. A better way to help these children: with devoted parenting.

At the heart of the problem is confusion over the nature of the transgendered. ""Sex change"" is biologically impossible. People who undergo sex-reassignment surgery do not change from men to women or vice versa. Rather, they become feminized men or masculinized women. Claiming that this is civil-rights matter and encouraging surgical intervention is in reality to collaborate with and promote a mental disorder.

evilalter-ego,"I've been on a lot of medication in the past but stopped for various reasons - weird side effects, mainly. I've been through the gamut of things - antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, antidepressants, anti-anxiety tablets, etc etc. Some of them helped some of the time but there was always a relapse and the side effects would get to me. It's been bad enough lately that I've considered asking to be put back on them, but part of the reason I came off them is because I want to have kids one day (catch 22 though, because at the moment I feel too crazy to have kids so it's certainly not something that will happen in the short term)

Re: question 2, it's been a long-running issue. I have had mental health issues since 15 years old when I was hospitalised for anorexia 5 times. At that time they also diagnosed me as bipolar. Then I had some serious drug issues, then I relapsed with the anorexia again and got diagnosed with BPD instead of bipolar. 
I think in reality a lot of it must be environmental since my mother has very strong histrionic / borderline tendencies, my dad abandoned us when I was 12 and had all kinds of messy affairs, my mum was suicidal, etc. Plus there was some weird abuse stuff going on. It's very hard to un-fuck your head once you've got into a weird groove.

You're right though, it's absolutely not fair to dump it on someone. Especially my nearest and dearest. I just desperately want to be fixed but need to do it my own self huh!!

anthx_,"I always thought this was the case, and placed the blame on why a relationship didn't work or why a guy didn't like me was because of my looks. It was just my low self worth talking. I knew I was okay looking, but I didn't think I was anything special. I also thought all someone could like me for was my looks- that I had nothing else to bring to the table. I've come to realize it's not my looks being the barrier in relationships, it's just compatibility. I just personally have so much emphasis on looks, that I think that's the only reason someone WOULDN'T want me.

I had a huge crush on a friend who's a male model. I didn't think he'd like me at all, tried to get over it but what do ya know we ended up dating. The whole time I was extremely insecure. I developed an eating disorder, thinking if I was more fit, he'd stay (for reference, my BMI was 20.. I had no weight to lose). We broke up and I was like no surprise there, look at me. In the aftermath of everything, he found out about the anorexia and was just in disbelief. He told me my looks were the last thing I had to be concerned about, that if you asked anyone they'd say we're on the same ""level."" He just didn't think I liked him that much. I was so insecure I had a wall up. We both knew we weren't compatible. I just refused to accept it since I liked him so much, but in retrospect it was true. He was a partying and skateboarding guy, I was a theatre and politics girl. I wouldn't say he thought I was too ""good"" for him, just he thought I'd be happier with someone else with more sophisticated tastes than him. After we broke up, he started dating the most average girl.

Have you ever attracted these ""hot men""? If you have, your issue isn't being less attractive. You might be undercutting your looks. You just haven't found one you're compatible with. When you're pickier or have a narrow scope, it's less selection. I don't think that's a necessarily bad thing to chase only attractive men, but yeah, it is harder to settle into a relationship.",AskWomen,t5_2rxrw,11

Starvation mode applies to actual slowing of metabolism, which only occurs in extreme circumstances. What she seems to be talking about is twofold: When you attempt a drastic restriction you are likely to fail. Not only is it not good for you long run (see: actual cases of anorexia) but people are prone to rebounding ""oh I was SO good for two days, barely ate a thing! I can totally eat this entire cake!"" And second when you aren't properly fueling your body you are less inclined to move as much. Over time the subtle reduction in daily activity will add up.  Add in fatty delusion and victim complex and they think they've ""starved"" because they felt hungry for a day or two and then when the weight doesn't come off they convince themselves it can't possibly be their fault...

cos1ne,"&gt;A man is a ""he"".

A man can also be a ""s/he"" when using a legal document, or a ""they"" when the gender is not clear from context. A dog can be a ""he"" even female dogs if the gender is unknown. 

&gt;Now, if people prefer to take offense at my firm resolution to not reject a plain reality

And the plain reality is that they fail to identify with the sex they were born with. By refusing to simply refer to them with another gender identifier you are causing them distress for no good reason. 

If a person goes to a doctor because they punched a wall do you expect the doctor to call them an idiot before they are treated? Or at all even?

&gt;Jesus is a male. I will not call Jesus a She.

Okay as far as I am aware Jesus did not suffer from Gender Identity Disorder. Nor is anyone suggesting that you call Jesus or God anything but masculine pronouns. So this is completely irrelevant, you do not get to take Jesus' name in vain to make your point!

&gt; Language takes on a deeper reality the moment it's used to convey an idea to someone and thus has the opportunity to deceive or mislead.

Who is being deceived? Both of you recognize that they identify as a different gender than their sex. Seems to be the least misleading thing possible for a female to male transgender to refer to ""him"" as ""he"". 

&gt;Two separate beings, one fictional, one real.

Even if they are just playing a role, it allows them to function in society so it does no harm to entertain their wishes.

&gt;Because that could cause them scandal, implying that there's a chance I think they really are the other gender.

Somehow I doubt your interactions with the transgendered would leave any doubt what you thought of them even if you used the pronouns they preferred.

&gt;Such a person lacks the integrity to examine my actions and their motivations properly

What actions? That you don't care about their inner most thoughts, that you don't care about their self-identity, that you don't care if you cause them distress? 

Their motivations could be as simple as just wanting to have some positive self-image. Most if not all transgendered individuals have very poor self-images due to the fact that their mental condition makes their very bodies feel wrong. Not recognizing this does harm them, sometimes even greatly and is why so many are driven to self-harm and suicide. 

&gt; That doesn't mean giving into (ridiculous) demands

Oh yes because saying ""her"" instead of ""him"" is such a harsh and nearly impossible request for you. 

&gt;I also have mental problems that I have to fight every day.

So then why are you so uncharitable to their plight? You would think you would have more empathy for them dealing with your own struggles. 

&gt;Maybe they should pray to St. Dymphna a lot.

And maybe you could answer their prayers by treating them with compassion instead of reminding them of how ""wrong"" their minds are.

&gt;Such people have no intention of ever changing any of their beliefs.

Yes because their beliefs are caused by a mental illness. It is very difficult to alter someones body perception. Just look at [anorexia treatment](http://www.mirror-mirror.org/facts-on-eating-disorders.htm) even with treatment only 60% make a full recovery, while 20% percent fail to make any recovery at all, meanwhile relapse occurs in 80% of all cases regardless of treatment. 

So yes you aren't going to change their mind because we do not have the capabilities to alter someone's mental state without damaging their mind and leaving them worse off. Since treatment is effectively impossible, what is the charitable thing to do? Provide for their emotional well-being, which includes using their preferred gender pronouns because it provides them psychological comfort.

&gt;I never said I do engage anyone.

Which is a tragedy. I think it would do you well to hear from transgendered individuals to see their views on the world. You might understand their personal struggle and be a bit more sympathetic to their tragic situation.",Catholicism,t5_2qi4f,2

potpocket,"The use of trigger today made me laugh hysterically during a therapy session when my psychiatrist asked me what usually triggers my cycles if there are any triggers. It's a perfectly legitimate use of the word. Same can be said for PTSD. Certain sounds can trigger a soldier and put him in a flashback. It's just ridiculous when I can't even take my own therapy seriously because of these self-diagnosing tumblr bitches.  
  
Second of all, here's the thing about triggers: during therapy you are taught coping mechanisms so you can DEAL WITH AND FACE YOUR FUCKING TRIGGERS. Triggers are not things you cower to and go cry on your keyboard while you wish you had the strength to have an eating disorder before remembering you had anorexia and binge eating disorder one day on the same day for twelve hours three years ago. Triggers are meant to be dealt with and you learn how to not let these things upset you anymore.

I love thigh gaps. So do loads of other girls. How dare they tell me what I can and cannot find pretty or inspiring. 

Having a thigh gap doesn't make you unhealthy, idiots. Carrying an extra 100 pounds does. (Though that's evil body shaming)

most fat people in this country are fat because of poverty and government corruption. the government subsidizes industrial corn for feed for animals and for corn derivative products like junk food. our taxes pay to artificially lower the cost of food that is low in nutrients. so if you are poor you eat food that doesnt satisfy your hunger that looks just like food that would. for example american cheese is 70% vegetable oil but labeled dairy. so poor people eat cheap food, are still hungry and eat more cheap food. So when you mock fat people you are mocking poverty.
Also various injuries and sicknesses can cause obesity, have you ever broken an ankle? had a thyroid removed? been clinically depressed? been disabled? When you mock fat people you are mocking injured people.

goodgod102,"Maltodextrin definitely. I can't gain or even maintain weight without it. I add 50-80g per shake as well as a shot of olive oil. All up it's about 4000kj per shake with creatine/protein. I have those 4 times a day, with breakfast, before and after training and before bed. On top of that, just eat as much as you can while maintaining a clean diet. Avoid sugar and saturated fats and focus on protein and complex carbohydrates. If you find yourself gaining too much fat tissue, just reduce or cut down the amount of olive oil (or grape seed oil) first and if that's not enough cut back the maltodextrin.

If you can get enough energy from your diet without having to add whole lots of stuff to your protein supplements, do that. For me, i'm still slowly recovering from anorexia and still have no interest in eating although I can sometimes feel hungry these days which is an improvement. I use the additives in my supplements so that I don't have to eat as much because I really can't face it yet.

If your parents were to dress you in a suit everyday from the day you were 1 until 18 it would not be considered abusive, just eccentric and maybe wasteful in the absence of other factors.

If a parent were to establish the same conditions currently in the modelling world for their child and only allow a BMI in the range of anorexia to be acceptable, then that would 100% in any court in the country be considered abuse.

If you have wide, angled hips and are relatively slim, you'll probably have a thigh gap regardless of whether or not you have an ED, and likewise, some people weren't built to ever have one.

I think the most common misconception is that it is about being thin. I have honestly never met a person who developed an eating disorder because they wanted to look like some photoshopped model. For us, its about perfection and control, it just so happens that thinness is a trait that our society admires, which is why we strive to achieve it. At a certain point, you are intellectually aware that you are not attractive and dying, but this irrational little part of your brain won't let you eat because you're still too big.

As a person who was anorexic without being underweight (i had a normal weight), i wasn't diagnosed with EDNOS. I was told i was borderline anorexic. You have no idea if that person was diagnosed or not. You say she's obese which you don't know for a fact, she says she didn't ""look anorexic"" not fat. If I had a penny for everytime an anorexic girl said she doesn't ""look anorexic"", I would be a billionnaire. They are all in denial about their appearance.

I heard a woman at work the other day say that she wished she had the will-power to be anorexic. Eating disorders are the complete opposite of ""will-power."" Your obsession over food and eating a healthy amount controls your life. 

Another thing I've learned about eating disorders are that everyone's symptoms can be different. My ED spans across all three of the main EDs: Binge Eating Disorder, Bulimia and Anorexia. I have episodes of just purely binge eating for a while, without purging. Eventually, I start to be overcome with guilt and start binging and purging and sometimes I just don't eat at all.

only_one_contact,"Source: 23F, dx with anorexia ages 10-13, dx with bulimia 16-present, recovering after multiple hospitalizations over the past decade, engaged to a loving and patient person in a stable 2-year relationship. 

The only reason my partner and I can be together is because I have a good treatment team holding me up (PCP, psychiatrist, therapist, support group) because my partner needs to be just that--a partner and not a caregiver. I go to my partner for things like a massage after a long day, cuddles and movie-watching, evaluating finances and future plans, and planning outings, etc. We try to make the relationship as healthy and drama-free as possible for both of our mental wellness(es?). 

It sounds like you're really romanticizing the two of you together. I'm sure you care about her very much but it may not be in her best interest to be involved in a relationship right now, and it may do you some good to learn what it feels like to stand on your own and eventually what it feels like to be with a *partner* instead of someone you have to take care of. 

The most loving thing that you can do in this relationship at this point is to act in her long-term interest before you cut contact post-breakup. It only requires one person to initiate a breakup. If she has said she chooses to break up, your choices are to either agree and cut contact or to drag out a messy chase/continued involvement between you and her. 

Seeing as DCF has been involved before on legitimate grounds, I would recommend bringing them in again. It does have some risk, since the people who staff DCF are only human and are making judgment calls to the best of their ability (not always perfect). But if she is willing to bring up her ED, they may help her get the treatment she needs. I had a friend who was taken away from her biological parents and made a ward of the state as a teen while she was hospitalized for anorexia for months. A decade later she has been at a healthy weight for years and became a yoga teacher with her own charity designed to bring yoga to the neediest populations. Being ""taken away"" was painful but ended up becoming one of the best things that ever happened to her. 

Again, it sounds like you care about her so very much and it is wonderful that she has neighbors who are willing to support her in person at the drop of a hat. It feels wonderful to have such concrete evidence that you are loved. That was a very caring action on your part and tells me that you are a very involved and loving boyfriend and for that I commend you. 

When you separate from your GF, she may get better or she may get worse. Bulimia can and will kill a person given a long enough duration and high enough frequency of purging. If you get really unlucky you might suffer a seizure or cardiac arrest from hypokalemia even at the beginning of the disease course. Your GF needs help badly. The breakup may become an extra ""push"" for her to get into treatment.

One thing I notice in your wording is the word ""break."" Going on a break in a relationship very rarely has any sort of success. Either the two of you stay together, or the two of you break up.

I would recommend breaking up. ",relationships,t5_2qjvn,8

And it just becomes something normal, just like any other slightly weird tread someone might have. We simply adjust our lifestyle to it and it at a certain point it somehow stops being ""that big of a deal"".

fennex66,"I also suffer with anorexia nervosa. The misconceptions that I have come across is that it's all about ""wanting to be thin and look good for others"".

That has never been the case with me. I struggle with depression in addition to my anorexia, and there's a lot of fucked up things that go into my thinking and eating disorder logic. Simply put, my anorexia is my slow suicide. I often wish that it would kill me, in one way or another. I primarily restrict and also exercise to compensate. A lot of it is also about having ""control"" (although it is a false sense of control) and having to be perfect at everything.

Numbers rule my life. Calories, my weight, the amount of calories eaten and burned, my measurements. No weight is ever low enough, nothing is ever good enough, and I am never thin enough. When my life is chaotic and I don't feel like I have control over anything, I turn to my eating disorder. It has been a big part of my life for the past 6 years, and it has only increased in severity over time.

Yes, I can rationally understand that I am underweight and should *probably* gain a bit more to be healthy, but fuck that, I FEEL like I look like a pig and I don't deserve to eat anyway. There's a lot of self-hatred that goes into it (I don't deserve food). I am very mean to myself. 

And eating disorders are NOT easy to recover from - I've been in and out of treatment centers and hospitals and outpatient programs, and I just can't seem to give up my eating disorder. Maybe I just have a death wish. Regardless, it takes YEARS, a lot of therapy, a lot of hardwork, and a lot of inner motivation to fully recover from an eating disorder. They are hell to live with, and I hate it when people say they ""admire the self-control/discipline of anorexics""- This is a hellish life, and I am not in control of it.",AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,3
have_a_word,"I have (present and past) some of my own mental disorders, and I'm very interested in them generally from a research perspective; also, a lot of friends and acquaintances have opened up to me about their disorders. I completely understand why people say things like you, they wish they didn't have these things. But I honestly think mental ""disorders"" are really cool (for lack of a better word). Society doesn't think they're cool, as evidenced by the difficulty of functioning in school, jobs, etc., everything that's structured for ""normal"" or ""average"" people. But I like my disorders, even if they do make things harder for me. And not that I'd wish mental disorders on anyone, but I would like to see the people who have them take them by the reigns. Mine help me see the world differently, experience my own life more meaningfully, and that's what I like about it that too many other people don't get.

Maybe you'll agree. Here's my theory. *People with mental disorders actually have more cognitive function, not less. It's not a deficiency of something, it's a surplus of something: thought.*

I really believe that most (if not all) mental disorders are essentially this: thinking *more* than the ""average"" person. *Just sheer quantity* of thought. I don't mean to generalize or hurt any feelings in saying this, just open some minds about how to see your own brain. I really think it's beneficial to characterize ""disorders"" this way. Most people with what others call ""mental disorders"" actually think *more* than those people ""without disorders."" And there are different ways of characterizing each type of hyper-thinking.

Try it on for size: Depression is *thinking* a lot about things so much that it's debilitating to actually *do* things (and the contents of those thoughts are usually of an unhappy nature). ADD is thinking a lot of different things in a short amount of time. Eating disorders often involve thinking about food more (bulimia and anorexia) or less (anorexia; or at least that's what they called it when I had it) than the average person thinks about what they eat. Stuttering is thinking so many things at once that you can't *say* anything...and then thinking about how frustrating it is that you can't say things...and then thinking more...and being more frustrated... OCD is thinking so much about a particular thing you're doing that you find it impossible to think about (let alone do) anything else until that one thing is done a certain way. Synesthesia, although it may not be considered ""disorderly"" is making associations between things that most other people don't. Social anxiety is overthinking social situations to the point of fearing them. PTSD is thinking a lot about a particular (traumatic) experience you had, such that you cannot think about or do other things. Bipolar: thinking a lot of positive things at once and then thinking a lot of negative things at a completely separate time, and not being able to control when.

And I really don't think there's inherently anything wrong with the capacity to think more. In fact, I think that the more we think, the better. But society thinks there's something ""off"" about you if you think certain things that they don't think. It's stupid. 

I don't mean to be reductive about any of these disorders. I've talked to a lot of people with each one of the ones I have listed above, many of them very close friends (or myself), and what they tell me very much corroborates the idea that a mental disorder is just a shit-ton of thinking.",AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,5

Neryian,"About a million reasons why I have come to hate oral antibiotics in reptiles, most of them now dead from sterile GI tracts. I have been extremely fortunate to get to spend the last decade working for one of the US's leaders in reptile medicine.  He is a contributing editor for the Journal of Reptile Medicine and Surgery, the acting veterinarian for the Ted Tuner Bolson Tortoise survival and recovery project as well as both our local zoos and Game and Fish both at the State and Federal level for our district, past president of multiple herp societies, has multiple conservation awards named for him, has co authored multiple reptile and surgical medicine books and if you would like to PM me I would be happy to link you our clinic website.  

So when he starts swearing and muttering under his breath about the 8th tortoise that month coming in severely anorexic and still having snot pouring from its face after 6 weeks of oral Baytril, I take notice and ask why.  GI absorption of system antibiotics is irregular and uncontrollable at best of times in reptiles and absorption of anything in a debilitated reptiles given oral is extremely sketchy.  All of the awesome research in absorption has pretty much come down to ""Well there are about 65 factors we might be able to control and about 500 we can't"". 

We do use some oral antibiotics and anti-fungals if we are treating a GI specific issue.  But for all other issues, its injectable or intranasal.  Sure Baytril can cause tissue necrosis if given SQ and an inexperienced owner is more likely to go through the muscle or not go deep enough or at the right angle.  For this reason we never send home injectable medications without the veterinarians giving a detailed lecture on how to give and what happens if its given wrong.  This goes for all injectables, not just Baytril.  

Currently our go to antibiotic for most reptile problems, especially tortoises, wild lizards and snakes is Fortaz. We don't see nearly the degree of anorexia that we do with baytril or gentamicin and we are getting better results.  

Honestly I have asked my senior reptile doctor when was the last Baytril caused tissue necrosis he has seen and he had to think back to way before I started there and that was caused by an inexperienced owner who figured if fluids can go SQ so can the other meds.

The truth is, anorexia isn't about being fat or thinking you're fat. It's one manifestation of OCD in which one of your obsessions is body fat. 

I have other manifestations of OCD also, but my eating disorder is probably the worst one. I feel dirty when I eat, and clean when I don't.

&gt;How about how plus size stores are always separated from the rest of the mall, or how stores that carry “regular” sizes and a plus size also separate and isolate the two from one another?

WHAT????? What kind of argument is this? They separate plus-size clothes, women clothes, men clothes, kids clothes, denim, shirts, jackets, you name it, for the sake of organization and ease to find out what you need.

Of course, they also resurfaced when I suffered from anorexia (""you don't deserve to eat"", ""you'll gain 50 pounds if you eat that apple"") but once again I managed to defeat them.  
And I know others can too! It's vital to remember that you're doing it for your own sake though, and not in order to please someone else.

shutup-you-are-wrong,"&gt;You're again just nit picking the source instead of the premise.

There is *no* source because the premise is *false*.

&gt;The references actually lead to a host of further articles suggesting the existence of sugar addiction. You've yet to point anyone to any evidence proving your claim.

Here's a link to a major European study that was published late last year. The authors found that ""evidence for addiction to specific macronutrients is lacking in humans"" and wrote the following material on sugar.

*""4.1. Sugar addiction*

*In all aerobic cells, sugars are subjected to glycolysis to produce pyruvate – the fundamental substrate used to generate chemical energy in the citric acid cycle. As such, mono-, di- and polysaccharides are essential components of our diet. Animals have specialized senses that allow them to readily detect the presence of mono- and disaccharides in potential food sources, and humans perceive these substances as sweet. Rats also prefer sweet-tasting sugar solutions, and solutions of artificial sweeteners perceived as having equivalent sweetness, across a broad range of concentrations without prior training (Sclafani, 1987). Thus, there seems to be an innate (or a quickly learned) motivation to consume sweet foods.*

***Apart from a single case study (Thornley and McRobbie, 2009), addiction-related behaviors in sugar consumption (such as tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome) have not been observed in humans (Benton, 2010).*** *Instead, most observational and mechanistic evidence for addiction to sugar comes from rat models pioneered in Bart Hoebel's laboratory (Avena et al., 2008). A variety of subtly different approaches have been taken, but most studies involve examining feeding behavior during intermittent access to palatable sugar solutions. For example, repeated 12 h food deprivation followed by 12 h intermittent access to normal food and a sugar solution leads to sugar “binging” (defined operationally as an increased intake compared to rats offered unrestricted access over the same time period). Furthermore, there is evidence that endogenous opioid signaling is active during sugar (but not fat; Bocarsly et al., 2011) binging, as i.p. administration of the opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone, results in somatic effects reminiscent of a withdrawal syndrome (Colantuoni et al., 2002). It was suggested that sugar recruits endogenous opioid pathways, with consequences analogous to those that follow consumption of drugs of abuse. However, these data do not imply that these pathways are being activated by a substance. Certain behaviors can also recruit endogenous opioid systems. For example, rats subjected to food restriction and given 1hr/day access to a running wheel show a withdrawal syndrome on naloxone administration, whereas much weaker withdrawal-like behaviors were seen in food-restricted or pair-fed rats not given access to a running wheel ( Kanarek et al., 2009). The underlying endocrine mechanisms relevant in this model which has been used to explain the hyperactivity of patients with acute anorexia nervosa go well beyond the opioid system and include an activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis induced via hypoleptinemia ( Hebebrand et al., 2003); adrenalectomy ( Duclos et al., 2009) or exogenous application of leptin ( Exner et al., 2000) prevents the development of hyperactivity upon food restriction. This complex model indicates that the combination of an environmental effect (running wheel) with a specific temporal pattern of food restriction entails both a specific behavior (hyperactivity) and profound neuroendocrine alterations that include the engagement of the endogenous opioid system in a manner analogous to opiate drugs of abuse. Thus, under specific conditions addictive-like responses may be attributed not just to substances but also to behaviors. Alternatively, a behavior may become addictive because of the system(s) it activates. In the context of sugar addiction, a behavioral addiction rather than an addiction to a substance also warrants consideration as an explanation for the observations made in the respective experiments.*

*Other models that evoke binging include a diet and stress model where cycles of food restriction and refeeding with palatable food are paired with acute stressors (Hagan et al., 2002). Given that this model explicitly uses a stressor and others use regular food deprivation (also a physiological stressor), these paradigms may represent a form of stress-evoked eating (Maniam and Morris, 2012). It is worth noting that in most of these sugar addiction models rats do not become obese. These rats down-regulate their energy intake from other sources and maintain a stable body weight (Avena et al., 2012), leading to the hypothesis that sugar addiction in humans – if it occurs at all – may not be relevant for the development of obesity. Since normal food intake is reduced after binges and weight gain does not occur, homeostatic mechanisms are preserved, it could be argued that these paradigms may better represent a form of binge-eating driven by intermittent access to hedonic stimuli.*

*In humans, addictive behavior is often accompanied by complex psychological/psychiatric constructs like memory, boredom, shame, guilt, habit, impulsivity, restraint, depression and anxiety. Undoubtedly, these contribute to behavioral addiction but this further layer of complexity is difficult to model in rats (Packard, 2009). Based on a rat model for cocaine-craving behavior (Grimm et al., 2001), Grimm and co-workers showed that rats responded to a tone + light cue previously associated with 10% sucrose self-administration; lever pressing during tests for resistance to extinction and cue-induced reinstatement of sucrose seeking in rats progressively increased over the first 2 months of withdrawal (Grimm et al., 2002). Environmental enrichment such as grouping four animals in a large environment with novel objects has been shown to strongly attenuate cue-induced reinstatement of sucrose seeking (Grimm et al., 2008). The beneficial effect of an enriched environment on substance addiction in rodents has led Solinas and coworkers (2008) to suggest that in addition to cognitive and behavioral interventions to target craving-inducing situations, a positive and stimulating environment per se could facilitate abstinence.""*

kiara5229,"As someone who's suffered from both anorexia and bulimia at different points in my life, and is currently at the low end of a healthy weight, I just thought I'd lend my perspective since I definitely felt that way.  Anorexia for me was about perfect control over what went into my body when I couldn't control my life; having my food all organized, watching the weight steadily go down on the scale - yes, I was miserable, and I used it to cope with depression, but I got a certain high off of it.  When I struggled with bulimia and some binge eating, I felt like I was a failure and couldn't control what went in and out of my body - I was at a healthy weight but felt fat and helpless to do anything about it, and because of this and my perfectionism I felt like I wasn;t ""good enough"" to have an eating disorder and I didn't get the same sense of control and feeling that I was doing well at something.

I know this may not make much sense to someone who hasn't struggled with an ED, and when I'm not in that mindset I can't comprehend it as much, but it felt very real to me at the time, so I can understand why they might want to have the ""better"" ED that implies more control, etc.

gameofthrombosis,"I'm glad You have posted this because I am having the same problem. I've always been petite, but definitely in a healthy way. I'm 25 and female and at my heaviest I think I made it to a junior's 5. I never had an eating issue throughout high school, I used to be very fit nothing but lean muscle. At 21 I had my son Xander, baby weight dropped almost immediately, but even then my appetite was normal. Its been the past 3 years I think I've seen a change from just being petite to unhealthy skinny. 

I just can't eat. That's not to say I don't love food, because I do. I thought maybe it was because of my tastes, even as a kid I was never into candy or real sweet and sugary things like birthday cake cinnamon rolls. Never was a big pasta eater, can't stand chocolate. So in general I've never delved into unhealthy cravings. Cravings for me are things like granola, nuts, dried fruit, and tons of meat. I used to be able to eat steaks to myself no sides, no sauce just meat meat meat. (iron deficiency)

I've considered depression a reason for lack of appetite, but even though things aren't perfect in my life, they're not that bad either. I own my condo, my son is amazing, my job sucks but it's not a strenuous one, so I'm unsure. I'm a tomboy so lack of eating to stay skinny to look good is not my forte so I was reluctant to call it anorexia nervosa. Sometimes I gt stomach pains but even then after a few minutes they go away and by the time I've decided to do something about it I'm not hungry anymore. I still go out to eat with friends and family, almost always have to take boxes home. When I do eat all my food, I feel lethargic, heavy, but full but one large meal is enough to last me that whole day and the full next before I remember to eat. Ive been trying to eat every couple hours some cashews here, a half sandwhich there, etc, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. I even went to smoking weed all last year. At first it totally helped the ""munchies"" get pretty real, but during the end of that reign, even smoking out of the big bong wouldn't boost my appetite so I gave it up. I know it's unhealthy because now I get sick easily, I lose energy fast, and paired with sleeping problems I'm becoming a wreck. Can't sleep can't eat sucks. Can't tell if it's mental or physical.

Foraging_Health_Nut,"I stuck with it for years, I really wanted it to be true. I really like sweet fruit, but I also craved avocados so bad, since my body needed fat, and I would feel so incredibly guilty if I ate one, plus I had trouble digesting fats and vegetables from weakening my digestion eating nothing but sweet fruit. I absolutely did not lose weight, but gained. 


Ok, wall of text, no need to read, but maybe others have had a similar experience:


I had severe stomach pains eating fruit meals. When I was living in Thailand, my stomach hurt more than ever (""melon belly"" as they call it) eating all sweet fruits other than papaya, dragon fruit and mangosteen. I felt sick eating bananas (I've discovered, I think, that I'm allergic to them; stomach cramps, mouth itch, face flush, no matter how ripe.) 

I eventually started eating some cooked foods for dinner (low-fat vegetables and rice) because I couldn't find enough good papayas (most of the available ones in the mountain village I was living in tasted like gross beer in the ""off"" season), and mangosteen/dragon fruit are very expensive. The pain got so bad at one point I could only handle cucumbers which I dipped in honey/lemon/cayenne, then even honey hurt, yet my weight shot up 15lbs. It was probably water weight and inflammation from sun poisoning and digestive issues, but still. It dropped to 140ish when I returned to the northeast USA,  but I was also restricting my intake and eating very little (but all raw/vegan.) 

I still maintained a chubbier physique than I liked, no matter how ""clean"" I ate, even when juice fasting on watered down grapefruit juice, and managing to drop my weight the same it is now (138), my body composition was different. I wasn't fat or overweight, just not as lean as I felt I should have been with eating almost nothing but fruit/greens, and super low fat. My calories stayed around 1,500 most days (I'm 5'8"", was around 145lbs most of the time then, fairly active, so I was eating at a deficit, according to calculators.)

Reducing my fruit consumption a bit and adding small amounts of animal products/more fat got me to 142 on average. 

My calorie intake is about the same now, usually between 1,300-1,600 mostly fat, moderate protein, under 30g net carbs (usually less), activity level is increased, but I've gone back up to 138 after having dropped to 135 a month ago (first month on keto this round.) Maybe muscle, but I took two weeks off working out other than squats and yoga to see if it would drop, but it didn't. 

Interesting that I haven't lost much, even gained weight recently, while keeping a better body composition on keto than when I dropped to this same weight juice fasting. I have the ""thigh-gap"" (didn't on fruit), less belly fat, lost an inch on my waist, more on my hips, and a smaller/more perky butt from squatting more. 
Would love the scale to drop again, hoping for 120-125ish, but I think my bmr is probably lower than calculated due to a long bout with anorexia and on/off restricting after ""recovery"" throughout all my teens and early 20's, so I have to eat a higher deficit. 
My body temp is generally a little low, and my bp is always pretty low. I'm trying to dispel the ED thoughts and behaviors, so I'm focusing on not restricting intake too much until my mindset is healthier.

mister_pointy,"Are you getting anywhere near enough protein?

Eating ""meals"" that consist of nothing but a pile of vegetables will certainly let you lose weight quickly, because they have practically no calories, but you're doing damage to your body -- it'll start cannibalizing your muscle in preference to fat in order to meat its protein needs, and that'll hurt your weight loss efforts in the long run (and eventually cause serious damage to your entire body).

Why are you concerned about ""fatty foods"" anyway? If you aren't eating an appropriate number of calories -- and you're definitely not -- then you should obviously be adding some higher calorie-density foods.

Are you deliberately asking for help with anorexia, or do you honestly not understand the concept of eating a complete meal?",loseit,t5_2rz8w,1
WellArentYouSmart,"Hey, I stumbled across this and I thought I'd give you my perspective. 

For what it's worth, most dysphorias are a side-effect of emotional issues. So for example, with Anorexia people first of all have an emotional issue and this expresses itself as a dissatisfaction with the way they look. In my opinion, this is most likely a response to abuse - they want to appear weak so as to invoke protective paternal instincts in others, so as to gain some form of protection from future abuse. Being malnourished is the ultimate sign of weakness, but it backfires because it actually just attracts more abusers. However, that's just a theory.

Gender dysphoria is much more direct. From what we understand, brain regions develop one of two ways based on your gender. Problem is, your sense of ""identity"" is closely linked to the development of the brain. In transgender folk, *some* brain regions malfunction and begin to develop as they would in a girl. This causes a lot of confusion over the owner's gender identity, because they have a nagging feeling that they don't fit into a linear box. 

The problem is, in most cases only one brain region is actually affected directly. These people get a sex change, and their identity issues essentially reverse because the majority of their brain is still ""male,"" so to speak.

She was not, by clinical definition, anorexic, but she definitely had an eating disorder and if it was left unchecked it would have most likely transitioned into anorexia. 

I think that they use the word anorexia because it's a word everyone knows.  People don't understand the word EDNOS.  It is misleading and in my opinion disingenuous to use the word anorexia to describe someone on the eating disorder spectrum who is not anorexic.

LittleRedPrincess,"That may mostly have to do with poverty. In a lot of countries that have high poverty rates, people start to put on a lot of weight once prepackaged food becomes readily available (status symbol), and they're expected to put on weight regardless because everyone is used to people looking like Skeletor. 

Because of the positive associations they have with putting on weight, they often fail to understand that the composition of what they're eating and the amount of weight they put on will eventually have detrimental effects. 

Some of it is purely cultural though. Patients from Mexico, as an example, can be especially frustrating because it's not unusual for them to think that everything (obesity, anorexia, smoking, alcoholism, pregnancy, etc.) is simply part of peoples' personality and not a medical issue of any kind.

AWorldInside,"I've had issues with doctors dismissing my BDD too. Because of my gender, the assumption is that I can't have a body image disorder, so I didn't get help for a long time after I began talking about things that would probably have been very alarming in a girl. 

I have the same thing going on with touching, except with my skin more than my hair, and checking in mirrors. 

I have a really weird relationship with mirrors. Looking in them always makes me feel worse because I hate my appearance, but if I don't I get an incredible amount of anxiety abut not knowing if it is worse than usual. I'll compulsively check in any reflective surfaces throughout the day, spoons, windows, computer screen, whatever, and sometimes I'll spend hours staring at them. What you said about going to different mirrors is really interesting; I'll circle around my house from room to room looking in all of the mirrors sometimes (less frequently than just staring into the same one) but I've never understood why I needed to see myself in more than one. Other times I'll go out of my way to avoid mirrors. I'll cover the mirror in my room with a blanket, turn the brightness up on my computer so it isn't reflective, etc. Do you ever do that? 

I focus a lot on my skin, teeth, and weight, but it isn't entirely specific. I know this sounds weird, but I kind of wish it was focused on just one thing. I feel like that might be easier to manage, I don't know. There isn't anything about my body that I like or that I don't feel some level of discomfort around. I do get that feeling of everything being generally wrong. Sometimes I look in the mirror and don't recognize myself, even though I know it's me, if that makes any sense. 

I also think of it more on terms of OCD than anything else. I have a lot of trouble explaining to people that it is not the same as anorexia or EDNOS (there's a possibility that I'm developing a co-morbid eating disorder, which further complicates that) but the compulsions definitely set it apart from other body image issues in my mind. 

With my skin, if I get a cut that scabs up, dry skin, acne, anything, I'll pick at my skin to make it smooth, especially my face. Intellectually I know it isn't that bad to start with and that I'm only making it worse. I can't stop even though I know that I'm going to form scabs where I messed up my skin and pick at those too, which keeps them from healing. It gets to be a cycle that I have a lot of trouble stopping. 

I haven't gone out of my house without makeup (just concealer and\or pressed powder) in years, which I feel a lot of embarrassment about. It feels really vain, but I can't bring myself to let anyone see me without it. The last time I left my house without any was when I was thirteen or so. I had an anxiety attack because I was convinced I was so hideous that everyone was staring at me. I have a compulsion to touch my face and skin, like you described with your hair. 

I sometimes scrub my skin raw until I bleed, like with the tooth brushing. I can take between an hour to get ready in the morning with the way I have to constantly check my appearance and repeat basic tasks. 

I constantly adjust how I sit, stand, and move to ways I think makes me look less fat. I weigh myself three times before I get dressed on a good day, and then two or so times before bed. On a bad day I'll periodically weigh myself throughout the day dozens of times, as if it would have changed within a ten minute period. 
 
I understand -- I don't like to tell people about my BDD very often because I want to avoid the connotations of being vain or shallow.

wattster,"Your friend's behavior is a disorder.  Unfortunately, you do not have much power to change her behavior.  The only person who can do that is her.  In disorders like anorexia, or addiction, unless the person can tie their behavior directly to negative impacts in their life (and sometimes even if they can identify those impacts but still believe the reward they get from those behaviors is worth the cost), they will not choose to change.

What can you do?  If you confront her, she might get defensive.  She might have the idea that what she is doing makes her superior to others.  You should set an example of your health and the way you live.  You can gently point out the connection between the working out and the problems it causes.  You should support her and encourage healthy behaviors when you see them.

You should also get used to the idea that you may not be able to do anything for your friend to make her stop.",xxfitness,t5_2ryzy,9

lgbtqbbq,"Unfortunately, like a lot of people here said, it's probably disordered behavior, and that won't be something that's fixed by your well-meaning input. It sucks, but when I had an eating disorder (was also addicted to exercise in a similar way) if someone brought up my behavior to me, it didn't make me stop and think, ""Whoa, they're right."" because I wasn't an ignoramus, I *knew* anorexia/bulimia/exercising till I vomited and injured myself was a BAD IDEA for my health, but I had a constant high from being starving and from depriving and punishing myself. I had mental health issues, and the way I dealt with them was by self-medicating, not with drugs or alcohol, but with deprivation and physical stress. I loved it. I craved it. I think about it now and get a sick nostalgic pang because even if I like being healthy and loving myself now, there was a horrible and  wonderful high when I was ""that girl.""

Your friend isn't ignorant of her behavior. She knows she's hurting herself. I knew I was hurting myself. My cousin used to cut herself, and she knew she was hurting herself too. It's horrible, I'm so sorry she's going through this and I'm so sorry as a friend you have to witness something which may cause her not only long-lasting psychological trauma but also physical trauma.

All the advice I can give is to be there for her (sounds so cheesy) but it's good to be around her more often because you may be able to ""catch her"" in a moment of weakness where she breaks down and admits her issues, and then you can take the opportunity to express your support/understanding/love for her. This breaking through isn't even necessary really. Just express your support and love when you can. When I was recovering, the number 1 external thing that helped me was remembering my friends' voices saying that they loved me and they wanted me to be happy. People who are addicted to exercising and extreme dieting/disordered eating don't always stop because it's hurting them physically, sometimes they stop because they remember that they should love themselves. It took me a LONG time to love myself, but I finally started to see the light at the end of the tunnel when I remembered that I *should* love myself, and that needed to be my goal.

Your friend needs therapy, definitely. If you guys are at university, you can talk more openly around her about the counseling resources available. Don't tell her to go, just drop it very clearly so that it gets in her head. When I felt like I was at the end of my rope and had nothing and no one (and was contemplating suicide), I remembered my friend talking about her good experience with the university psychologist office, and I went there the next day.

Ultimately you should just get her talking more, period. The more she connects with others who love her, the more she will remember that her life is valuable and that she deserves to be healthy and happy. But don't take on too much...she has mental issues that belong to her alone and that need to be worked out in the privacy of a professional atmosphere. If you get overwhelmed, you should consult with a therapist even just once and get their opinion on the best way to speak to your friend. They may be able to suggest an Eating Disorder Support Group in the local area, which may be an easier transitional thing for your friend to try if she can't or won't go to therapy.

itsmyotherface,"1) Bad joints. Not arthritis, but an alignment issue in my hips of unknown origin. A doctor has looked at me and my gait, said ""there's something messed up, you need to see an orthopedist"". I've just never followed up. 

What this boils down to is that I walk funny, and running (at all) and walking (distances of more than ~1 mile) are painful. I compensate by doing things like yoga (when I can be arsed to exercise). 

2) Meds that cause weight gain. I've been on a number over the years. Some made me hungrier, one made me sleep eat. Chips and cookies were my sleeping snacks of choice..but almost always carbs. 

To be honest, I started out taking those meds when I was ""recovering"" from anorexia. At that point, I could have put on 60lbs before the biggest shitlord doctor would have said ""put down the cake"". Even while not monitoring my intake, and eating shit like 6 frosted sugar cookies for breakfast, I was putting on weight at a pretty slow clip (less than 1lb a month).

spacebe,"Your story is perhaps identical to mine. I've was just like you, getting less and less hungry, and couldn't eat. But in my case, and I suspect it could be with yours as well, the lack of appetite was hiding something far more grim.

My advice:

 * go to a doctor, tell him/her about your problems. Tell them everything , the more they know the more they can help.

 * they will probably want to take blood tests or other routine tests to rule out other causes of appetite loss. If they don't find anything, it's probably psychological.

 * if it is depression or anxiety, look into those. Try to understand the illnesses. Realise that it is an illness, not a state of weakness. It's not your fault, and can be treated, like any other.

 * if it is depression etc, you will probably be offered talking therapy (counselling).

 * they may also offer drugs. There is controversy around antidepressants etc, whether they work or just make money for companies or make it worse, but I would recommend keeping an open mind. Drugs are what saved my life, in the end. They don't make you happy, never will, but in my opinion they do a fucking great job (if you're lucky) of suppressing the symptoms long enough for you to sort yourself out. They would likely bring back your appetite, which would allow you to eat, bring back some of your self-esteem, which would help with the actual illness. They do come with a fair share of side effects, but are a relatively quick fix (a few weeks on average) compared with talking therapy, which can take months, or even years

 * Oh yeah. Try to make them understand that although it is an ""eating disorder"", i.e. you're not eating normally, it's really unlikely it's anorexia or bulimia or similar. The cause is likely also psychological, but it's different, and the treatment is very different too.

I used to think it was something special, going without food for long periods of time. Then I found out it was a mental disorder making me do it. I did get better, with help. And, although life's not like a happy woman in an advertisement, it's pretty good.

&gt;Ingestion of small amounts of boric acid or borate salts by animals has resulted in clinical signs that include excessive salivation, thirst, fever, vomiting, retching, depression, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The vomit or stools of exposed animals may contain blood or have a blue-green color.

&gt;The onset of clinical signs following boric acid or borate salt ingestions is usually within 2 hours.

&gt;Following ingestion of large amounts of boric acid or borate salts, animals have also shown signs of ataxia, tremors, seizures, decreased urination, and can develop reddish-violet colored skin. Suppressed growth, reproductive sterility and testicular degeneration in males have also been observed. 

&gt;Seizures from massive oral ingestions of boric acid can be followed by depression, metabolic acidosis, coma and death.

&gt;Signs reported in animals following the chronic ingestion of boric acid include anorexia, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, hair loss, anemia, kidney damage resulting in difficulties urinating and death.

&gt;**Dermal *exposure* to borax has resulted in redness or inflammation of the skin.**

Because I was at a low weight, I had to go into hospital (at the time I was under 18 so I was in the children's ward) and get better there. It was tough at the start, I had to have a ng tube, and before I started eating regular food, I moved onto things that we call Ensure in the UK, they are basically drinks or yogurts with a high energy content (I try not to think about the calorie content) so that you are able to work on the other things around you and be able to think clearly without being extremely hungry and malnourished.

• 91% of women surveyed on a college campus had attempted to control their weight through dieting. 22% dieted “often” or “always.”5

• 86% report onset of eating disorder by age 20; 43% report onset between ages of 16 and 20.6

• Anorexia is the third most common chronic illness among adolescents.7

• 95% of those who have eating disorders are between the ages of 12 and 25.8

• 25% of college-aged women engage in bingeing and purging as a weight-management technique.3

• The mortality rate associated with anorexia nervosa is 12 times higher than the death rate associated with all causes of death for females 15-24 years old.4

• Over one-half of teenage girls and nearly one-third of teenage boys use unhealthy weight control behaviors such as skipping meals, fasting, smoking cigarettes, vomiting, and taking laxatives.17

• In a survey of 185 female students on a college campus, 58% felt pressure to be a certain weight, and of the 83% that dieted for weight loss, 44% were of normal weight.16

Men:

• An estimated 10-15% of people with anorexia or bulimia are male.9

• Men are less likely to seek treatment for eating disorders because of the perception that they are “woman’s diseases.”10

• Among gay men, nearly 14% appeared to suffer from bulimia and over 20% appeared to be anorexic.11""

BED was first really noticed in the late 1950s/early 1960s but wasn't defined as it's own eating disorder, not an EDNOS, in 2013.

BED is eating abnormally large amounts of food in a shorter than normal time period, which could be one sitting or over the course of days depending on the person and binge episode. It's common to eat so much food you become physically so full you are in pain but to continue eating. On top of just the general over-eating there's also feelings ranging from guilt, shame, and loss of control present during bingeing episodes. Unlike bulimia BED involves no compensatory purging behaviour.

You dont just stumble upon a desire to ""not eat enough"", you form an addiction circuit to it. 

Hunger is natural and very important to satiate. Without enough food our bodies shut down and die. No one who isnt clinically anorexic just ""doesnt enough enough"" to get vital nutrients for survival. Sure, a lot of people dont get important nutrients from plants because no one eats their god damn vegetables, but a normal person is likely not only eating ""enough"", but more than enough, unknowingly.

As you probably know, personal experience and anecdotal evidence is considered one of the lowest forms of credibility in the scientific community. How did you verify on yourself that food residue in particular was removed? What about the food residue was affecting you negatively? Is it possible that you were removing things that are beneficial to your health too? Did you verify with any medical professionals that what you were doing was beneficial? 

&gt; it is a common principle of human health that overuse of any organ--digestive organ, respiratory, etc.. leads to illnesses

True, however It's also a common principle of human health that going long periods of time without food leads to illness among other medical complications. Talk to anybody recovering from anorexia, it does horrors to the human body in some cases. It is also common principle of human health that under-use of some organs leads to illnesses as well. Take the heart for example. People who don't raise their heart rate though exercise or other means have a much higher rate of heart failure than those who do.

That's because you're trained to do with it... which amounts to being trained to oppose it since sex is a natural urge every human being has.  Being able to follow those urges will take time, probably a lot of time and experience.  Re-training yourself after decades of experience is difficult.  Abstinence is like anorexia.  Eating is healthy, having sex is healthy.  Not eating causes health problems, not having sex causes health problems (mostly longer-term ones than eating, but health problems all the same).  Often it's an issue of control.  Natural urges arise and you resist them, then you start to identify yourself with your ability to resist them, the disciplines you invent to stay away from them, etc.  Losing control makes you feel either like a bad person or, at least, 'less you'.  Changing things like that are probably the hardest things a human being can do, especially later in life.

RememberKoomValley,"After my mother's twin died at the beginning of last year, and it turned out that what killed her is going to kill a bunch of my family, I had a very involved nightmare where I found some sort of time-machine and went back to when I was nine or ten years old.  Before my abusive father had taken off, back when Mom still had a little bit of soul in her, before my brother and sister took an accidental bullet that would change the way they viewed the world for the rest of their lives, before a lot of things went just-a-little-wrong (which has led to so much pain, almost more than 20 years later).

In the dream I decided I'd fix things. I'd put up with whatever beatings I had to from dad to make it so that Mom could see what he was, and would get rid of him earlier, so my sibs would grow up sane and whole.

 So that my brother didn't become a bitter ragebeast whose girlfriends move out while he's at work for fear of angering him. So that my sister didn't get anorexia from Mom's incessant ""If you eat that you're going to become a whale"" manipulation.  So that the youngest brother had the therapy he needed, speech and physical, to not get the shit kicked out of him every day in high school.

In the dream I grew increasingly panicked, trying to figure out what thread I needed to pull to fix this. By going back at all, I'd destroyed the existence of my half-sister, who I love dearly--mom would never have taken up with my stepdad, if my parents split when I was a ten-year-old instead of it happening years later.

And then, there's my partner. He's eight years my senior--how long should I wait, to contact him? Any man who would take up with a child is filthy. So until teenhood at least. Should I spend that time making money? 

Steal from Dad's wallet, invest somehow, as a child?  Make sure that my sister gets the medical care she needs early, that all of us get diagnosed so that we'll live into our sixties instead of whatever we get out of life now?  Get the other sister her scoliosis diagnosis early, too, before it requires an 80k surgery that leaves her with six titanium rods in her spine and a permanently damaged self-worth. So many things to fix.  So many things I have to make not-happen.

The dream ended with me being eighteen years old, walking into the dojo that I joined in real life at the age of almost 25.  ""I'd like to join,"" I tell my Sensei, and he starts me off with a basic walking step, something that beginners take weeks at before they're any good. In real life, I've been practicing for eight years; in the dream, add to that the additional nine from my relived childhood on, late nights spent practicing kata in the street while my family sleeps, just to try to keep a hold on who I was.  

Sensei looks at me and sees a prodigy, because he never knew the woman who fainted two practices of five for her first two years. He never knew the clumsy, uncertain girl that he raised from depression into stability, and now he never will.

When you ignore them for so long, it can be hard to reestablish hunger/satiety cues.  ED patients need to fix their heads before they can hope to have a healthy view of food, and frequently that involves ignoring calorie and nutrition content until they have the coping skills necessary to deal with classifying certain foods as 'better' than others and/or counting calories.

The sickest EDNOS patients were those who had dropped more than 25 percent of their body weight before diagnosis. These patients had been overweight and had lost weight too quickly and dangerously in order to end up at what is typically considered a normal weight.
 
“People were initially just patting them on the back for their weight loss,” Peebles said. “It often took months or years for others to realize that what they were doing didn’t seem healthy.” Despite their normal body weights, this group was in some ways worse off than underweight patients diagnosed with anorexia, she added. “They manifested criteria of severe malnutrition.”

zeusa1mighty,"&gt; The food pantries don't solve the problem, they're a stopgap measure to keep people from starving because society, through the government, had decided that they're okay with requesting months of paperwork proving that you're actually starving before giving food to starving people.

You are engaging in a massive amount of hyperbole here.  Most people applying for SNAP benefits are doing so so they can eat BETTER.  Cheap food exists.  You can get a sufficient caloric intake from McDonald's (a *restaurant*) for $3.00 a day.  So please, unless you have sources to back up that ANYONE who is not dependent on another person is starving simply because they don't have money, please source it.  Otherwise, just stop.  You are focusing on the wrong problems.

&gt; The fact that over 3000 people did in 2011 (and likely more have since then given the cut backs in SNAP, TANF, and WIC) is disgusting.

This number includes children who were intentionally starved by their parents through malice or negligence, those who were pulled off of feeding tubes and those who die from complications due to Anorexia/Bulimia.  I couldn't even find a source that showed how many people died in the US *ever* due to lack of access to food.  Source it from one place, please.  Just one.

&gt; the perfect example of what's wrong with this country, by the way.

I could say the same for you.  You pick a cause and trumpet it without even knowing.

&gt; Just because only a few thousand people die from it each year means, in your mind, that it's not a big problem. 

Exactly; indeed the MUCH LARGER problem (pun intended) is the morbid obesity in this country.  More people die from TOO MUCH food than from not enough food.  You have to look at problems from a statistical standpoint when deciding public policy.  I'm not happy that anyone dies of anything; death is tragic regardless of the cause.  But you have to acknowledge that starvation is not a big problem in our country, despite what you may think.  In fact, it doesn't even make the [top ten](http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/pdf/leading_causes_of_death_by_age_group_2012-a.pdf)^pdf list.

If you are going to spin things to intentionally deceive, I don't want to talk to you.  If you want an actual discussion, please leave your exaggeration and intentional deception behind; we shouldn't be fighting as a country over these benefits because they aren't solving major problems.  Those funds would be MUCH better spent educating people on how to eat right, or helping people quit smoking, or any other number of things.  Government subsidies such as SNAP are *enefficient*.  They promote bloat, are highly susceptible to gaming, and encourage people not to be productive.  Instead, let's spend more money helping find treatments and cures for cancer or heart disease (which, along with type 2 diabetes that you cited, is *much* more likely to be caused by OVEREATING than food insecurity)",news,t5_2qh3l,1

andapacketofcrisps,"I think that it's not uncommon for people who restrict food to wind up bingeing either during recovery or in between periods of restricting. There's actually a binge-eating subtype of anorexia, which doesn't necessarily involve purging (tons of info will come up if you Google it). I don't know how much that has to do with societal pressure, though. Maybe it's easier for the brain to transition between different disordered ways of eating than it is to build a healthy relationship with food and cure the underlying mental issues. Again, a more knowledgeable shitlord might be able to help.

That said, there is a difference between overeating and binge eating disorder (BED). BED is when you feel compelled to eat everything in sight, often to the point of severe discomfort. You barely taste anything, you don't enjoy it, you just have to keep eating. Binges don't last all day, though, or even happen every day. They're a response to anxiety and a desire to dissociate. It's a miserable feeling. Overeating is when you just eat too much, either for one meal or regularly. A lot of Americans overeat on holidays, for example. Regular overeating is how you end up eating 3,000+ calories a day (or even just a couple hundred more than you need, which is how people let the pounds creep on as they age). Both are unhealthy behaviors, but you don't have to have BED to be obese.",fatpeoplehate,t5_2x9xz,9
leelem0n,"&gt;Why is it that people have to invent ""disorders"" to normalize their weaknesses?

It isn't inventing things to normalize it, it's that we notice a pattern, recognize there's a problem, and have to try to create ways to fix it. Attempting to ""normalize"" it would mean that we're trying to say it's okay, and that's not it at all. Paedophilia *is* a psychiatric disorder. Where did you get the idea that calling something a ""disorder"" means we're trying to make it ""normal""?

&gt;Do these obeasts look in the mirror and see an anorexic person and think that they need to eat loads to not be a skeleton?

No. What you're describing is body dysmorphic disorder, not an eating disorder, and to say that they ""see an anorexic person"" isn't even an accurate phrase as anorexia is a mental problem not a weight. While weight is required for the anorexia nervosa diagnosis, just being underweight for your height/gender does not mean you are anorexic. On top of all this, if an obese person saw ""an anorexic person"" in the mirror, that would mean they believe they suffer from anorexia nervosa, which would mean they would *stop eating* instead of shoveling food into their faces. 

An eating disorder is closely tied to OCD/anxiety in a lot of cases. There are diagnostic criteria for these things. It's not just someone being stupid and shoving food in their faces for fun and then saying, ""Teehee, it's a disorder! It's justified!"" It only occurs in a very small percentage of the population (as in, not most or many obeasts) because only a very small percentage of the population has this problem. Again, it's not just eating a lot of food, and dismissing it as such does everyone a disservice. 

The key here is to recognize similarities between people who have the same mental problem, figure out why the problem exists, and figure out ways to treat it. I have no idea why you think that finding out ""broken"" thought processes somehow is an attempt to make them accepted. It is the exact *opposite*: it is recognizing a problem and figuring out how to go about fixing that problem. You see a paedophile and think, ""Holy shit, fuck that fucker!"" whereas the psychiatric community sees a paedophile and thinks, ""Why does this person have a sexual attraction to children? Is there a way we can fix this? Is there a way we can recognize the signs and fix this behavior before it manifests?"" These are all absolutely beneficial and necessary things for society to progress. ",fatpeoplehate,t5_2x9xz,6

OoLooLoo1,"Well nobody said anything about oppressing fat people, I just wanted to know if HAES advocates would still preach that every size can be healthy if there were in fact a tipping point where an extreme size became inherently unhealthy. I honestly fail to see why HAES advocates decide to make things a moral issue, most of the questions I see are met with that response. The article even states that they wanted to fight the false stigma that obesity indicates a lack of willpower, but that that aim is not met by denying comorbidity.

“We want to fight the false stigma that individuals with obesity lack willpower, but that is not accomplished by creating the false notion that obesity is not associated with significant medical comorbidities,”

And I didn't read it in the way that you did, maybe I completely misread it that could be the case. But when I read it I took it as though the concept of 'Obese Health' is only 'Healthy' in comparison to obese people who suffer from weight related illnesses as opposed to being compared to people who are at a more 'healthy' size. The article also mentions that even people considered to be 'Healthy Obese' still have a greater risk of developing type two diabetes.

To make my position clear I just want to state that I do not believe that a persons size is a result of a moral flaw or lack of willpower. I am also all for body acceptance but I do take issue with people preaching an unhealthy lifestyle. My perception of the available information is that being of a certain size leaves you more vulnerable to certain diseases and ailments, and given the option between the two lifestyles I find no real benefits to being larger as opposed to being a smaller size. I also believe that this cuts both ways and nobody advocates anorexia or bulimia as acceptable lifestyle choices, I think the same can be said for the other end of the body size spectrum.

mrsamsa,"&gt; I meant specifically that every person with a mental health disorder is a mass shoot in sheep's skin.

I haven't claimed or implied that you said this. The statement I have issue with is this:

&gt;Every time there's a mass shooting, every time someone who is obviously disturbed does something that harms people, remind people that the problem isn't guns/knives/etc, the problem is mental health.

It's factually incorrect. Very rarely is mental illness the problem, so why would you feel compelled to bring it up when there is a mass shooting or when somebody disturbed harms someone?

It's like saying ""every time there is a car crash, every time there is a bad driver out there we should remind people that the problem isn't inadequate road codes and poor driver training schools, the problem is Asian drivers"". 

It's just wrong. It's so badly wrong that it adds nothing useful to our understanding of the issue and doesn't help us fix the problem at all.

&gt;Also, a large percentage of mass shootings are attributed to mental disorders. Again, see Adam Lanza.

Practically no mass shootings are caused by mental illness and Lanza is highly debatable. He was diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum as a kid and had no other diagnoses. The school nurse suspected he had OCD, his dad thought he was ""schizophrenic or psychopathic"" (as if those two are related and easily confused), and there are reports of him being anxious and maybe having anorexia but it's mostly just labels thrown at him from non-professionals with no reason to think he actually had them.

He stayed from late November to Christmas Eve of 2014 in a medical facility an hour and a half away from home. During his stay, he fell and fractured his right humerus. They sent him home in a sling with a cocktail of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and synthetic thyroid hormone. They gave us no preparation, no training, not even the slightest bit of advice on how to take care of him. Visiting hours never coincided with the hours that doctors worked there, so we had no way to talk to them.

My experience: When I was nosediving into my illness, I pushed the closest people in my life away - my family, my best friend, my other closer friends. I found I latched on to acquaintances and people who didn't know me so well, and thus probably didn't recognize my drop in weight and/or monitor my health as closely. My eating disorder could thrive AND I could have somewhat of a social life with people who didn't know about my illness. At the time I wasn't really aware of what I was doing, but looking back it was obvious that this behaviour protected my anorexia.

From what you've said, it sounds like a lot of what your friend is doing resembles my own experience. My best friend and I didn't talk for a good 8 months until I decided to start my recovery and to this day I'm amazed that she hung on for so long and was willing to reconnect once I was at a better place. It's entirely up to you whether you want to stick around or give yourself some space. Your friend might be so deep into a relapse that she can't see the disorder for what it is right now, maybe she's not willing to admit that she needs help. Sometimes you need to start losing your friends to see how damaging and consuming the illness has become - that was the case for me.

If your friend is very sick with a relapse, please try not to take her moodiness personally. I promise it has nothing to do with you, it has everything to do with her. I was bitter, angry, irritable and miserable to be around when I was sick and I took it out the hardest on my family and friends because they were the ones who expressed concern and challenged my ED behaviours.

This is going to be an almighty rant...

Ok, lets start with the trigger, this ""fantastic"" BBC article:
http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30735673

Now reading that you may thing ""wow, thats really bad"" and have all the expected reactions/emotions. How could a country pass such a law, etc etc. Most people would leave it at that and accept this ""news"" from the supposedly reputable BBC at face value. It's from the BBC, it MUST be true.

But I decided to see if this was all a load of bullshit, seeing as I've read far too much bullshit regarding Russia on ""reputable"" sources such as the BBC lately.

Now, lets find the actual text of the law:
http://government.ru/media/files/A5X9GSAYrpA.pdf

I dont expect you to read Russian, but if you do or use Google translate, have a read.
The context for this law is that Russia up to now has not had any or sufficient laws for refusing to grant a license if you have some mental or physical disorder. In countries like Australia you typically have to answer a question on a license application as to whether you have any conditions that may disqualify you, eg: epilepsy, schizophrenia, etc etc. This Russian law is an attempt to institute this type of procedure, to combat the high number of road incidents and fatalities.

Anyway, moving on. So this law basically stipulates that if you have disabilities such as ""no fingers"", ""no hands"", ""restricted field of vision"" etc etc, then you may be refused a license. In addition to this, it also says that if you have a mental disorder falling under the ICD-10 classification, then you may also be refused.

Now what is this nefarious ICD-10? Well, its a list by the WHO (http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/V) of various mental illnesses such as mental retardation, schizoid personality disorder, etc. The ICD-10 is broken up into several categories. One of them, F50-F59 (http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/F50-F59) includes things like anorexia, and ""sexual disorders"".

So maybe now we see how the BBC arrived at their conclusion. Maybe they selectively chose to focus on the fact that this law potentially bans people based on ICD-10 mental disorders, which include sexual disorders. Clearly this is a case of cherry picking the ""facts"". 

BUT NO! The fucking law EXPLICITLY EXCLUDES ICD-10 disorders of category F50-F59!! Page 2 of the law explicitly lists which categories of ICD-10 are included, and F50-F59 are NOT INCLUDED. So What.The.Fuck BBC? ﻿",russia,t5_2qh75,7

At 5' at 105lbs and female your stomach simply isn't that big. If you are eating to your full capacity every time you get hungry then you aren't anorexic. [Your BMI is 20.5](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm) which is in a healthy weight range and doesn't indicate anorexia. You aren't even underweight.

Fatigue can be caused by almost **ANYTHING** and it doesn't sound like you have a weight problem (anorexia).

The clue I gave you is I either think you are anemic or have a vitamin deficiency as your diet, weight, gender, and symptoms all are indicative of both anemia and vitamin deficiency. 

&gt;Matter of fact I haven't paid for internet in quite some time - it comes with where I'm staying. And with the situation I described how am I supposed to save up, scrounge around on the sidewalk hoping I find enough spare change?

How do you pay rent? Utilities? Do you live with someone who pays that for you? That is fine and if so I am sure they will be more than happy to loan you $4 to get something that could potentially make you feel a lot better.  To say it is **impossible** for you to come up with the means to get a bottle of vitamins simply isn't true, and I can't see a justification for it.

Honestly this is not as big of a problem for men.

Muscular and lean? those are good things. To get that kind of body, you have to exercise and eat right.

No, it's a theory stole from someone else and it's too awful to to believe. 

Its makes sense, an ""invalidating environment"" causes the BPD to have an instability of self (sexual orientation, gender, self perception problems such as anorexia feelings of ugliness, who they are etc). 


Leelahs parents were horrible, what really solidified my ""theory"" about the cause of BPD (plus my own experience unfortunately) was reading the forums of parents raising BPD children. There is some awful (narcissistic ) parenting going on over there, and is the other side, the narcissist parents version of this sub-reddit. 

It's unbelievable, for example, sending the NC/LC child crappy gifts (like the parents favorite CD's!) is common, taking bedroom doors of hinges (seems compulsory), reading their BPD childs diaries (that's normal ha ha), claiming their kids are prostitutes (when clearly they are not), contacting the kids therapists (against the kids wishes), talking about ""us"" instead of seeing the child as a person separate to them. Just what we read about on this reddit but from the other side!

A great example which really hit me hard on the BPD parents forum was a mother telling a story of her teenage daughter. The teenage girl had parked the parents car wrong, was out late and didn't return home when she was supposed to. Anyway the girl returned home to hear a good friend had committed suicide and became really upset.The BPD parent went easy on her and gave her 30 minutes to grieve before telling her off about the car and being late!.

lalala-,"You might be thinking of someone throwing up anything they eat, in which case they are exclusively purging and probably anorexic and will definitely lose weight.

Bulimia is different, it's binging AND purging--not *just* purging--so people's weights tend to fluctuate. For example, someone can eat normal meals and then also have episodes of binging/purging in addition to average eating habits, in which case their weight will maintain. However, it is often hard to purge all calories consumed after massive thousands of calories binge episodes, in which case they can gain weight. Except some people fall so deeply into the disorder and end up binging/purging every meal in which case they could lose weight because they aren't eating at all outside of a binge/purge episode, so they are purging majority of calories consumed. So yes, you can maintain, gain, or lose weight with bulimia.

That being said, she could be bulimic or she could just be binge eating. Both are eating disorders and none of us can diagnose over the internet.

**EDIT** My post was completely about what makes someone bulimic, NOT about anorexia. However, apparently people are becoming confused and think I am defining anorexia??? NO. I was explaining the misconception of someone who purges their food intake and has rapid weight loss as a bulimic. Anorexia is characterized by someone who is severely underweight due to lack of food intake. This can be because they are purely restricting, quite traditional definition of anorexic. But if an anorexic eats something and throws it up, guess what? They are still anorexic. Anorexia Binge-Eating/Purging Type has been specified in DSM IV for *years*.

*TLDR;* my post was NOT about anorexia. It was about bulimia. But I threw in some education about anorexia in my edit to clear up the very confused responses I'm getting. The more you know!!",offmychest,t5_2ranw,5
wellfuckmylife,"OP, get her help as soon as possible. She may not want it, but she genuinely needs it. You're completely right in thinking she has an eating disorder. Specifically BED. (binge eating disorder)


This can be managed with QUALITY therapy and a strong support system. Who else does she normally interact with? Friends? Family? She might be very isolated either by her own means or circumstance, which won't help.

The way she's feeling about herself right now is very dangerous, she could end up doing a number of things ranging from self harm, suicide, or even developing another eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia.

As for the timing for these outbursts there could be a number of reasons, she could be trying to not cause trouble but the stress leads to an outburst at the last moment, like challenging a fear and chickening out last minute. It could also be her trying to ask for help but not really knowing how.

I speak from personal experience on most of this, I really hope you can properly help your wife, it might be the only way she could get help considering how she's shutting herself in.",offmychest,t5_2ranw,1

oncewild,"I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa when I was seventeen and was in and out of treatment until I was about twenty-one. I haven't been ""behavior/symptom free"" for a solid two years since I was a teenager, but those days are few now and I have maintained a healthy weight since my early twenties. I'm what they'd call ""in recovery,"" which is what I put on my health history forms both when applying to the Peace Corps and the previous organization with which I worked.

That being said, I moved to Tanzania when I was twenty-four (2011) and straddled the relapse line pretty hard for several months at the beginning due to homesickness, lack of my support system, and a change of diet. That last one is HUGE--particularly for folks who share most meals with a HCN as I did. I went from having a familiar and safe meal plan to eating what felt like incessantly! Everyone wanted to offer me food, and it was considered rude to refuse their generosity. Sometimes I ate multiple dinners a night.

I'd encourage your friend to think about what her support system looks like. What helps her stay on track in her recovery? Will she still be able to access those things while serving in the Peace Corps? What would she do if she did relapse and where/how would she reach out? There are some countries where eating disorders are a completely foreign concept, so finding support could be difficult. Most importantly, why does she want to be in recovery?

So i too went through obesity and anorexia.",Fitness,t5_2qhx4,3
Crowned_Son_of_Fire,"Yeah. That kind of extreme is a sad one too. 

Personally i feel that most people would be of a healthier weight if they would stop listening to dumb fucks like Dr.Atkins and all those other celebrated ""doctors"" with a diet and a mission to make (North) America skinny. I am in Canada, but we have a similar problem here too, hence the north part. 

It all starts with a person coming onto the idea that they are too big, which for some, is true. Then they try the diet, only to find it doesn't work and or makes their size worse, because golly gee, your body is missing nutrients due to a dumb fucker telling you not to eat those things, and so your body goes into overdrive to collect those nutrients because it knows it wont be seeing them again for a long time. 

So, now you have gained weight, thanks to a weight loss diet and now you're desperate. Que Anorexia/bulimia. Or somehow worse, fat pride. 

I am starting to rant though so i will finish with these last few... paragraphs.  (Edited, used to say points.)

Your body, needs all sorts of nutrients, and your fat cells are how the body stores those nutrients for later. Being a little larger than the norm is not a bad thing. It is when you are taking up the space of two people on the bus is when you need to reconsider your size. Otherwise, focus more on keeping your muscles toned with some semi-regular exercise, drink less super sugary substances, and for fuck sakes people stop consuming fake sugars/ syrups. Those last two things are some of the biggest contributors  to over sized people. It does two things. It gives them the idea that they can drink that diet cola and eat two pizza's and the bucket of chicken instead of just a normally healthy sized meal with a glass of water or heaven forbid a cup of tea. The second thing it does is that it tricks your body. Your body has no fucking clue what to do with those sugars. But it knows what to do with sugar, which it is tricking your body to believe it is, so your body stores it for use later, since you already have a sufficient blood sugar level to begin with. This, is the biggest reason why diet colas seem to contribute more to weight gain than weight loss. There is evidence for this as well, not that i can source it right now, but a healthy adventure to a university library should help those who would prefer a google link. 

Oh, and that fat on the meat that you might be wanting to discard. Eat that too. Your body wants it more than you might be aware of. Too much lean meat or carbs for that matter can lead to something known as rabbit famine. Most commonly seen in societies that focus on lean and super lean foods. RF (Rabbit Famine) has been recorded to cause people to drink liquid fat. Why? Because their bodies are craving fatty acids. Those same fatty acids are part of what helps your body keep in shape in the first place. Along with other important things like brain function. 

In the end, everything i am saying boils down to this. Eat when your hungry, and exercise when your not eating. If your not able to exercise within a reasonable time, go ahead and eat, but try to avoid the sugars, especially the fake ones.

the_supersalad,"This question plagued me for years. I was a fat child, and a fat teenager, and eventually wound up with one eating disorder (binge eating) and then another (anorexia) and then a third (bulemia). And now... I'm fine. 

Through the process of going from unhealthy to healthy, I gained a good few insights in answer to the aching question of why some people just don't seem to have to deal with all that crap.

Firstly, as much as I wanted there to be ""one answer"", the slim, health people in my life all ate differently and still had different relationships with food. Some loved it, some hated it, but they weren't fat. The biggest common thread I found, which a few people have already mentioned,  is that they didn't use food as an emotional bandaid. Oh, they had other things, from drugs and alcohol to sex or shopping or other detrimental coping mechanisms. You just couldn't see their vices as clearly as you could see my fat. And yes, some had health coping mechanisms like exercise and hobbies and friends. 

It's a funny thing, trying to get into the head of a ""naturally thin person"", when you aren't one. There are some great responses in this thread, but maybe a good way to frame them to move forward is, how do you want to eat when you become naturally thin? If the thought of being set loose on all the food without having calorie counting to stop you from overdoing it fills you with anxiety, then you're not there yet. But that doesn't mean your not on the right path. Don't worry about calorie counting being unsustainable: it's like training wheels. 

On the side note about alcohol, I eventually found a balance for myself with food, where my life is just too distracting for food to be a focus anymore. It's great now, but for a while there the only fun thing in my life was drinking with friends and I was one of those ""drunk 3 or 4 times a week"" people, on beer, no less. It just didn't affect me. on those days, I often went over my calories, but not by a lot. Food was replaced by beer. Not healthy, but it balanced calorie - wise.  

Don't dispair! It will take time, but after putting in all the effort to count the calories and learn about your needs, you'll figure out how YOU eat when you're naturally thin, and it just won't be a thing anymore.",loseit,t5_2rz8w,2
FinnSven,"It is different if you are continuing playing something you did as a child with other people who grew up with it.

Though, even if they simply collect the toys, that is also viewed as odd.

As someone who currently struggles with anorexia and bulimia (and has so for ~10 years now) what kind of treatment did you find the most beneficial? 

How have your thoughts toward food changed? Right now, I can't see food as anything more than a weakness and can't manage to enjoy it or activities that revolve around it - like going out to dinner. 

I struggle with thinking of purging as weak but necessary and restricting as a sign of self control and strength. Did treatment address these feelings?

fuzzysham059,"Thank you!

Individual therapy I found was definitely my favorite and most beneficial. My main thing I struggled with was that my weight wasn't low enough and I wasn't considered anorexic but that I had ED-NOS (which I know most ED patients can associate with, we aren't taken ""serious"" until we are almost just skin and bones). But I poured my heart out to my therapist who was great, and she made it clear to me that I had anorexia and it didn't matter what medical books said, and for me it was like a mark in time. Once I had ""achieved"" this, I could move on. It sounds strange, but it sort of made a difference. That and the tattoo I got along with it. 

I also did group therapy, which was so-so. It was great to be around others that knew what you were going through, but physically being in a room with them was hard because you were constantly comparing yourself to their bodies which was just really difficult. What I REALLY recommend, is the book ""Life Without Ed, by Jenni Shafer"". You've probably heard of it, you might even have it. But when I read it I felt like it was written about myself. It's like you can totally relate to her!


When I was in the middle of my disorders, I still had food that I liked ( such as sushi and chipotle), but I did purge afterwards. Now that I'm recovered I'm able to enjoy them without having to worry about what to do afterwards. The same goes with other foods. Its a healthier relationship. Sometimes I order dessert. Sometimes I eat seconds until I'm uncomfortable full, but then I lay down on the sofa and then I feel better, because now that I don't have ED's voice in my head anymore, I KNOW that rationally, I didn't just gain 25lbs and become ""fat"".

The treatment I had did address about the feelings of control and strength from restricting, it is a major part as to why ED patients engage in those behaviors, I know I did!

This is kind of a weird question to answer because I always was confident in myself and my body and I always thought I was a pretty girl, I just wanted to be skinnier for myself. I knew i had a great personality and was a good friend and great daughter but I just didn't think I was skinny enough. Now that I'm recovered and 189lbs I don't really care anymore, I have muscular legs and long shiny hair which I'm proud of ( and a cute dog who is my everything). But back then it was more like I would just like to be skinnier and see if I could do it. It was a different situation than most especially encountered in my group therapy sessions!

If you have any more questions ask away!

First of all, make sure the people you work with are aware of your other conditions if they aren't already. They will need to work with the BDD and anorexia to help you get better.

What would you think if I told you that you could live a life not hating your past appearance and feeling a constant need to distance yourself from it? Or eat some food without the anxiety the comes along with it? I think you're aware enough of your disorder to realize that most people don't suffer like you do, but it's hard to really *understand* it.

I got OCD therapy when I was 24. I always knew I had OCD, but didn't think it was ""that bad"". Like you, I've had it for as long as I can remember (very different symptoms though). And it gradually worsened over time, so it was hard to see how deep in I was. I had therapy for about a year, and I had so much improvement. I never knew how good I *could* feel. I never knew how bad I was suffering until I felt what it was like to get better. If I had known it could get this good, I would have had therapy years earlier.

It's hard for you to see the light at the end of the tunnel because your disorder feels normal to you. But your life can and will be so much better after the therapy. It really can be significantly better than what it is now.

I don't know how your specific program works. I understand your concern about taking medication, but hear me out. If you don't want to take medication, you probably won't have to. But I think you should at least be willing to consider it. It can help your behavioral therapy to be more successful. Hopefully you can try therapy without it, but at least keep it as an option if you are struggling. Every medication has different side effects and if you have a good doctor, you can work with them to try out different types of drugs and at the minimum dose that is effective for you. You might find one that doesn't cause the bad side effects for you. At least keep it open to consideration.

My behavioral therapy was not nearly as intense as yours will be. But, it was actually easier than I expected it to be.

toritxtornado,"Sure thing! I posted this on Facebook for National Eating Disorders Awareness week 2 years ago.

In middle school, there was very little more that I wanted than to sit at the popular kids’ table. I never did. I was average. I played soccer and basketball, but I usually started on the bench. I was in the school plays, but I never had a lead role. I wasn’t ugly, but I wasn’t gorgeous. I wasn’t fat, but I wasn’t skinny. I wasn't stupid, but I was never the smartest in my classes. And I had 4 siblings that solidified this feeling of mediocrity. I was a Smith kid, but there was no way to define myself other than the ‘little sister.’ I wanted to fit in so much, but I also wanted to stand out. My mind was in a constant battle, my anxiety was unmanageable, and my fear of being lost in the crowd was at the front of my mind at all times.
 
When I was in 7th grade, I watched a TV movie about eating disorders. Because it was made for TV and wasn’t a boring health video, it didn't talk about the health consequences or the nitty-gritty of the disorder. Instead, it glorified eating disorders and made it seem like something one could do for 3 months and then soon get over. It intrigued me. It was the exact thing I was looking for. I had tried other versions of self-harm, but none of those provided me the relief I craved. Nobody could see how much I was hurting, and they needed to know. So that day, at Target with my mom, I decided to refuse the smoothie she bought. I was hungry, and I wanted a sip of that smoothie so bad, but that day, I decided to change my life. That day, in that very instant, I decided that I needed to control my life, and I felt that the best way to do that was to control my eating habits. I didn’t have to give in to the hunger cues that my body was giving me; I was above that.
 
By 9th grade, I had hit my lowest weight. My parents tried sending me to a psychologist, but I lied and said I just wasn’t hungry. I knew weight loss was a symptom of depression, so I convinced everyone that I lost my appetite because I wasn’t happy. They put me on anti-depressants and thought that would cure me. What they didn’t know was that I was starving at all times. One day at my friend’s house, I ate some trail mix. I couldn’t stop thinking about the calories in the mix, so I went upstairs and purged the food. I started purging at school, at home, and in restaurants. Fortunately, my friends recognized what was going on and decided to write a letter to my mom (who worked at my high school) and put it in her mailbox. After about a week, I got called into my assistant principal’s office and was met by my principal and parents. They had a bag packed and said I was leaving right then, in the middle of my 9th grade year, to go to inpatient treatment at an eating disorder hospital. I was angry, but I also was excited. I thought that maybe – just maybe – I would be able to find my way out of this eating disordered hell. When I got to my very first inpatient stay, I was 82 pounds, and my blood pressure was 76/32. I remember that number exactly because I truly believed I was going to die. Unfortunately, that wasn’t enough to scare me into helping myself. Soon into my stay, I had to sleep in front of the nurses’ station because they caught me exercising in my room. I asked one of the girls that was only there 12 hours a day to buy me diet pills and laxatives. I was still a slave to my anorexia.
 
I am now 24. Last summer was my 8th stay in a treatment facility. Two years ago, I missed Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s, and my birthday in a 3-month residential stay. I have missed many birthdays of loved ones and family vacations, and I have missed 4 Easters. If I string together the amount of time I have spent in different treatment facilities, it totals over a year. Imagine where you were one year ago. I spent that time living away from family and friends and tackling my eating disorder. I have an arrhythmia, gastritis, acid reflux, GERD, a hernia, and osteopenia, and there is a possibility that I will never have children because I went years without my period. I wish more than anything that it didn’t take me 7 years to graduate college due to medical withdrawals for treatment. I look back on the last 11 years of my life and cannot believe I wasted all of this time, energy, and money on this disease. 
 
But I also know that it was not my fault. Eating disorders are not about food or weight or vanity. They are a disease that people do not ask for, and they tear apart lives. Those close to me still have to deal with my eating disorder, but they do not have to worry that I will keel over and die anymore. As of last Fall, I can honestly say that I am in recovery. I am not working towards recovery, and recovery is not an abstract thought. Just last summer, I was at a residential facility in North Carolina bawling and hyperventilating because the chef poured olive oil in the rice; now I can eat hummus (with olive oil!). I have maintained a healthy body weight for longer than any other time post-treatment. I can order French fries. I ate a red velvet cupcake with cream cheese icing a few months ago and ate banana cake on my birthday -- and I kept both down. I am in the process of reversing most of the health consequences from 11 years of torturing my body, but there are some that cannot be reversed.
 
There is nothing in this world that I wish I could change more than the decision to not drink that smoothie at Target. I still struggle and have daily battles in my mind, but they are getting less prominent. There are some days that I struggle and give in to my eating disorder, but instead of treating that as an excuse to spiral, I can overcome those mini-battles and continue to take more steps forward than back. However, I never would be where I am today if I didn’t receive help. My friends took a huge leap by writing that letter to my parents when I was in 9th grade, but they don’t realize that they saved my life. I would not have stopped until I was dead. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. In fact, 20% of people suffering from anorexia will die from complications related to their eating disorder, and these deaths can come well after somebody has entered recovery. Eating disorders are an addiction, a compulsion, an obsession, and a slow (or sometimes quick) suicide. They are not a diet or a joke, and they will ruin your life. I was lucky to make it out alive, but I know many people who have died at the hand of their eating disorder. It is not something to be ashamed of – getting help shows true strength. More people are struggling than you realize, and you are not alone. An eating disorder does not mean you are broken, crazy, or weak. It means you have a disease you did not ask for, and suffering in silence is not necessary.
 
Statistics:
 
5-10% of anorexics die within 10 years after contracting the disease and 18-20% of anorexics will be dead after 20 years.
 
Anorexia nervosa has the highest death rate of any psychiatric illness (including major depression).
 
The mortality rate associated with anorexia nervosa is 12 times higher than the death rate of ALL causes of death for females 15-24 years old.
 
Without treatment, up to 20% of people with serious eating disorders die. With treatment, the mortality rate falls to 2-3%.

Of course, everyone is different- if you feel stable mentally, that's awesome. I'd still bulk to gain more muscle mass if not fat.

liberaces_taco,"My good friend has a serious eating disorder (she nearly died at around 60 pounds.)

Whenever she gains any weight we praise her like crazy.  Hell, whenever she eats ANYTHING we praise her like crazy. Who gives a shit if it is a donut covered with cheese and mayonnaise (realistically she would never eat that, but you get my point.)

I question if this person even truly has an eating disorder because trust me, when you have a serious eating disorder people never will say anything about you gaining weight.  Ever.  You are praised like a little child for anything you put in your mouth.  Not just me, but her parents, her husband, even distant relatives who just barely know what happened.

I imagine if she got to a place where she was constantly maintaining her weight and was no longer skinny we may not constantly praise her, and if she even gained say..100 pounds we might stop all together, but we would be VERY careful to criticize her weight.  

Then again, she has severe anorexia.  So, IDK, maybe we just view it differently.",fatlogic,t5_2wyxm,2

When older people stop eating, everything goes down-blood pressure, cholesterol, hemoglobin, etc and they get depressed. I work at a nursing home collaborating with doctors and staff.

The Wikipedia page on Bodily integrity says that for Canada bodily autonomy is mostly respected, but there are cases where that can be overridden (like force feeding someone dying of anorexia), it doesn't mention anything about a deceased person's will. I would think they would make exceptions with things like having someone's thumb made into a trophy, and I know the US has laws on what body parts can be owned such as a human body part that is under a certain age might be illegal to buy/sell/own.

""Depending on the services you choose, the deceased person may be moved to a funeral home, a transfer service, a cemetery, or a crematorium. Unless you or your family intends to carry out the services yourselves, only a Provider may offer funeral and transfer services. If you choose burial or cremation, you must involve a cemetery or crematorium. If you are going to move a body out of Ontario, you should speak to a funeral home or transfer service provider.

Donating the body or organs: To donate organs for transplant, or the entire body for scientific research, arrangements must be made quickly and directly with health professionals.

For those that don't know, he wasn't in good health mentally when he disappeared - he withdrew £200 a day from his account prior to his disappearance, wrapped up a big box of books with a note to an anonymous girl he'd always loved, gave a big book of lyrics to a fellow band member and best friend (Nicky Wire) and checked out of his hotel on the morning before a promo tour of America.

He was obsessed with JD Sallinger and the perfect disappearance but he also was obsessed with Ian Curtis of Joy Division who committed suicide before a US tour. 
There's equal evidence for both him still being alive, and him committing suicide.

His car was found at a service station near a popular suicide spot (The Severn Bridge), BUT the battery was run down and the car was full of food wrappers and bags of photos and other things - he'd been living in there.

His sister has been campaigning for years and you can just see the hurt in her eyes and it's so raw that her brother may not be coming home. She's an amazing woman.

But yeah. No trace of him after arriving at that service station has ever been found - nothing has washed up, none of his clothes or belongings were found other than the car and it's contents.

For example, she states that she had Otherwise Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder but then she also has a separate diagnosis for atypical anorexia. But atypical anorexia should be *part* of the OSFED diagnosis as the specifier for why she doesn't meet the full criterion for anorexia. 

And yes, there may be a slight diagnostic differentiation between social phobia and social anxiety depending on who you talk to (I think it's kind of like the difference between irrational fear of social encounters and irrational worry about social encounters, if that makes sense) but given the thing with her EDs, I have to think she's just trying to squeeze as many diagnoses out of her mental state as possible.

UnaBarbaAzul,"If I'm being completely honest (and you can't lie on the internet, everyone knows that), I completely understand where your husband is coming from.  There's nothing in the Significant Other Manual about what to do you when your better half has a history of disordered eating.

I don't know if your husband was around for the whole course of your anorexia or your treatment.  Furthermore, I don't even know what you *did* for treatment.  

My thought is this:  If you're not actively getting treatment, then maybe you could schedule a one-time session with a registered dietitian or a doctor of some kind that both you and your husband go to, and he can see that your plan is medically OK to be doing.

If you are actively getting treatment for your ED, then see if you can bring your husband to a session with you one day so he can verify this with your care team.

After that, you can talk to him about trying not to surprise you with food because it interferes with the plan and makes it hard to get healthy.

Of course, this assumes your plan is actually healthy to begin with, but only you can answer that.

Alect0,"I am almost 30 but at your age I was pretty much like you are. As a kid I would literally sit at the dinner table for hours eating my dinner as I'd cut the things that I didn't like up into tiny tablet sized pieces and swallow each bit with a sip of water. I wasn't allowed to leave the table until I was done and I kept this up for years. I also had anorexia for most of my teenage years and spent a lot of times just not eating anything. 

To me what has helped me get over being so fussy and foods making me sick to eat has been learning to cook more and more meals over the last decade. When I can cook my own meals and control what goes into them it became easier to cope with adding new foods so now I eat a wide range of food from all sorts of cuisines. Any kind of pressure on me to try something new from others did not help me at ALL. I would eat it as a kid as I knew I had to but would get sick and still not end up liking it. If I got a surprise taste or texture sometimes I would throw up or gag, just couldn't help it. But if I knew it was coming I could prepare for it. 

For example the texture of mushrooms made me sick, even just thinking about it. If I found out something had mushrooms in it I would feel grossed out after I had eaten it. One day I decided to learn to cook beef stroganoff and the first time I make a recipe I hate deviating from the instructions so I knew I had to figure out a way to incorporate 200g of mushrooms. I cut them up into tiny tiny pieces and they dissolved into the sauce and because the texture was gone leaving just the flavour I could handle them. Now I can even handle bigger pieces of mushrooms but I still don't like the texture. 

I still get a very upset stomach when I eat very spicy food but at least now I can eat mildly spicy food and I imagine if I keep making incremental increases to how spicy the food is then I will get better at tolerating it.

Long story short Im one of the biggest of all my friends now and spend nearly all my time and money looking at gear, talking abut it, posting about it, and daydreaming of being in the gym.  

So yeah I've been becoming more accepting/outspoken of my problem recently, if you have any issues with body image like me, stay the fuck away from steroids and bodybuilding.  I'm going to be cycling them for the rest of my life now and I will never be happy with where I'm at.  I need them more and more after every cycle, they occupy my every thought.  I can just never look good enough, I will always feel weak and small and ugly.  I'm more reluctant now to take off my shirt than I was before I looked like a greek statue, I literally see a different person in the mirror than everyone else sees.  

Most of you can't really relate to the whole steroid thing but the best way I can put it is to imagine feeling like a fat kid out swimming at summer camp where all the other boys are in good shape and staring at you.  Steroids are obviously not addictive in and of themselves but If you have that self consciousness and feeling of being exposed and inadequate, then you get some temporary relief from something like steroids, its over.

FuckThisMate,"Hey so I grew up in a household with two people who struggled with anorexia / body dysmorphia. Suffice it to say, I did not have the healthiest opinions about my body. While I am not going to claim I know what you went through, I experienced a mild form body dysmorphia (at least according to my therapists) and was bulimic from the ages of 14-20. 

My entire life I *loathed* every curve, flab, and feminine nuance of my body. I hated myself when I looked in the mirror. I hated clothes. I hated getting dressed in the morning. BUT I chalked it up to ""All woman hate their bodies this much"" (Thanks for that line of thinking, Mom!). However, after a while I started to wonder whether this hatred had a different source. I ventured into dressing male and binding, and it was like... I don't know... this burden of self-hatred that I carried for so long just disappeared. I don't hate myself anymore, I don't hate my body and my self-worth is no longer correlated with how much weight I can lose. 

The moral of my long winded story is this: Focusing on your body might bring up traumatic memories. You might look at transition and think, damn I do not want to spend every waking moment focusing on what I hate about myself. That's what I thought too, when I first started transitioning. I thought it would be the same kind of hell, like ""dysmorphia"" was. But it isn't. Instead, every day I feel more and more at peace. Happier. Whereas when I throwing up or skipping meals, every day there was a new flaw to look at.

In my experience, I don't think transition will derail your life. I don't think it compares with dysmorphia as much as it might seem. It is way more positive.",ftm,t5_2t9mw,2

But this morning, after a year of trying to learn how I eat properly I finally realized that I was eating WHEN I WAS HUNGRY!) 

The road to recovery started when I moved in with my boyfriend. I started by eating when he eats to get on a decent schedule.  Then (about 6mo in) I slowly started to eat on my own.  This was tough, sometimes I'd overeat still and sometimes I just wouldn't eat. Now I feel hunger and fullness! It's amazing! I honestly thought there was something biologically wrong with me and I could never deal with food like everyone else.  But you CAN get over it.  It's long term though! You have to trust yourself to feel full later.  When I started, I had a hard time not purging after binging since I didn't trust myself to not continuously binge.

sejhammer,"Autogynephilia has been debunked again and again. Your professor shouldn't have even mentioned the word because it is absolute horseshit.

EDIT to add: http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Autogynephilia (read through this)

I actually do know a trans woman from the UK who's been diagnosed with autogynephilia (yes that shit still happens in 20fucking15) and the overwhelming response is that her doctors are discriminating against her and using her comorbid condition (bipolar disorder) as an excuse to micromanage her transition, despite her identifying as a woman and getting her hormones through gender clinic since 2008.

Zinnia Jones has written some cool tweets about this in the past and trans feminists have said a lot about it in general. It's NORMAL for a woman to be turned on by her own body. If autogynephilia were a real thing, lots of cis women would have it! It's an old way of thinking that comes from the desire to pathologize trans women.

Now someone is going to comment that autoandrophilia is the FAAB version, but that's so much not a thing that even idiot old school doctors never diagnose anyone with it.

After reading your post... Maybe you're non-binary! If you really think you'd be more comfortable if you moved physically toward one end of the spectrum, the main routes I'd suggest are testosterone or birth control pills (some people get huge boobs on birth control pills and soft skin and stuff--you can ask your doctor about the side effects and see if you'd like to try one). If you wanted to try testosterone, your primary care provider might be willing to prescribe it to you but they might not. For that, I'd had to an informed consent clinic for trans people, say you're figuring yourself out and would like a more masculine body, and see if they're willing to prescribe to you.

As far as therapy goes--a good therapist is not going to make you feel like you're mentally ill and fucked up. You absolutely need to see someone who has a history with trans clients and specializes in patients who are questioning their gender. As a non-questioner, I skipped therapy and got testosterone from an informed consent clinic (like I mentioned above).

Things you wrote that remind you of me? I knew I was gay before I knew I was trans. I knew I wanted to fuck men and I thought it was just a quirk of puberty that I wanted to fuck them with a penis. I was no stranger to fasting/anorexia, so body dysphoria seemed completely normal/something I would expect to have. It took me a few years to sort through everything, and nothing fell into place until I met a trans woman and realized gender transition was possible. Then, in like 3-4 weeks, I went from a total mess to having a great foundation of understanding myself and what treatment I wanted to finally be at home in my body.

I thought that I was fetishizing gay men. That if I told a gay man about how I masturbated all night thinking about gay sex and had a huge gay porn collection that they would find me laughable or repulsive. If you [check out videos of interviews with Lou Sullivan](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLGU4_zfkF615Y2EB35DbTvTs34Aq5Cc5) in the late 80s/early 90s, you'll find that gay trans men have a long history with these feelings of guilt. That's something worth examining and working through. There's a light at the end of the tunnel.

I had a period where I presented as a woman long after coming out as a man, and I did it extreme-femme style (although no makeup, because I never learned how in the first place). It was fun to put on the girl suit sometimes but the novelty wears off.

Feel free to post here more. I'll try to always read and respond with a comment. It's good that you're looking at yourself. The anxiety is bad--we want to get a handle on that. Talking to a therapist would be good if you can get to where you're up for it.",ftm,t5_2t9mw,12

adoarns,"Well there's not much data. Some case series maybe. There are in vitro and animal studies looking at some of the specific phytocannabinoids such as THC (main component of must recreational pot; psychoactive effects) and CBD (second main component; main component of many ""medicinal"" marijuanas; non-psychoactive).

A number of these compounds appear to have antiseizure effects in several mouse models of epilepsy. THC and some others may have a proconvulsant effect--it's not clear. Overall there was more anti- than pro-seizure effects with THC, but the psychoactive effects will prevent its ever becoming a medication for epilepsy. (Although synthetic THC is an approved drug given for nausea/anorexia and sometimes tic disorders.)

CBD and CBDV are probably the chemicals researchers will focus on in the next few years. There is a trial of CBD for Dravet syndrome in the UK, and I believe an early trial of CBD for epilepsy being organized in the US.

Of my patients with epilepsy, a large number admit to using cannabis at least some of the time. My guess is probably 1/3 to 1/2 stop doing it and get better seizure control. The others it may help. Who knows why? Different dosing, different strain, different administration method, whatever.

Patients with epileptic seizures should not go to the psych ward anyway. It's not a psychiatric condition. They should be treated in the ER and then seen by a competent neurologist.

I know on GWA people downvote others in order to get themselves to the top page, some guys do it to guys, girl do it to girls, people downvote kinks they dont like or people they dont like. Blah blah b-s.

* People are shitty. Face to face, behind backs, comments, pm's. That will never change. They love internet drama and being on a high horse. 

* Fucking women. I agree. I have complained about someone messaging me asking to fuck and play over Skype. I mean okay I make erotic audio, I get it yeah but damn it at least say hey or something first. I'm all for your filthy messages and dick pics, just say hey and at least give me hope for a nice conversation. **DPP &amp; R4R** is a circle jerk. I had a guy not believe me on the shit about what women get in messages so we created a fake account on R4R and I gave him the password and let the messages flow in. You can have the sweetest of posts and you always get those freak messages. I kid you not you will get 40 messages in like the first hour. People will spam you like 3 different messages when you haven't responded fast enough. It sucks. If I post on R4R I will respond to everyone like I do every comment, it takes time. It may take like 2 days but I will respond. If you are a freak and message me something I asked you to not do, then you do not deserve a response from me. I will not message you again. If my post specifically says ""do not message me dirty things I want a nice conversation"" then fuck you people that message dirty things. Nice conversations I will always keep going. (It is hilarious to me when people send the same messages to everyone. When they slip up and don't even bother changing the usernames xD)

* **I gets a shout out :D eek!** I will rape and pillage the users of GWA. haha. Like we talked about, its crazy tame. I mean just talking really its vanilla there isnt much rape or abuse, abuse tag was for safety precautions. (you keep saying weird here and its making me laugh, I like the way you say that word) Long story short: its just an audio calm ya panties. 

* Maleness. Obviously I like hearing guys, girls too. Mmm mmm. You aren't homophobic or transphobic(?) that's just your preference.  Guys turn you off like fake moans turn me off. 

* *Body types* this is gonna be interesting. I am someone that does enjoy a bigger guy. There is a part where you mention someone like 400 lbs, no that is not okay. Its dangerous. No shaming at all its just dangerous to you. Yes everyone is beautiful in their own way but something that is dangerous to your life (anorexia, obesity, etc) that is not sexy. I don't mind bigger people, I've always said that. I want you to be happy about yourself but know the difference in being happy with yourself and just accepting yourself.

* Gosh dont talk about grades. I was totally the kid that wanted to tell myself getting a D was okay. I was a fuck up in school, life kicked my ass.

* ""It doesn't matter how you treat other people because you aren't responsible for anyone elses feelings."" ..........I will slap the hell out of someone like that. How is the view on that high horse you dick? People like that make me sick.

I began to self induce vomiting. I was diagnosed with purging anorexia. My weight fell to 112lbs. I was literally dying. My pulse would fall into the 20's when I slept. I could barely walk any distance. I had no fat, almost no muscle left, my body was ravaged. I was offered a bed in an inpatient eating disorder treatment center. I refused, and even though I was a minor, my parents didn't force me to go. So I gained weight a bit. To make a long story short I developed bulimia, which I believed caused more damage than my anorexia. I gained a lot of weight - as is typically with bulimia. I also began self injuring at 16. The two addictions go back and forth. Both may be present but when one disappears the other comes back with a vengeance. 

It takes a lot of self hate for someone to will inning destroy their own body. I can't tell you exactly where all my self hate comes from, but part definitely comes from when I was physically/sexually assaulted as a child. As a result I feel I deserve the self abuse and any suffering. 

Every time I purge or injure myself, I am driven by the need to change my emotional state. A lot of the time I am overwhelmed. I use my behaviors to cope with things that would be otherwise too much. 

As strange as it sounds my negative behaviors keep me alive. I cope with suicidal feelings by cutting or purging. This is hard for people to understand, but I need to point out the obvious: there is a lot of control that goes into holding a blade to my wrist and self injuring versus attempting suicide. Control. There's that word again. 

When I cut, my past comes into play. My assault involved a knife which I silently begged would cut my skin. I wanted there to be proof, I wanted to be able to point to a wound and say ""they hurt me, look"". But that didn't happen. So when I cut I will sometimes say things to myself that were also said years ago by those who assaulted me. I am essentially living out my past experience over and over again. 

Someone asked me today about my self injury. They asked if I felt pain. This is very hard to explain. I do feel pain but I don't feel it as a bad pain. Sometimes I'm so emotionally numb that I physically don't feel the pain as I slice open my skin. Often though, I feel pain and that doesn't stop me. I want to feel this pain. This is also pain that is expected and intended. For example, I can self injure to a pretty serious degree sometimes. Yet if I trip and stub my toe on the table I will let out a string of obscenities as I fall to the ground. There are different types of pain. Intentional pain is far different than unintentional pain. 

At times my behavior leads to me not necessarily trying to kill myself, but really not caring if I lived or died. I've purged and blood has come out. This happened several times and I always kept going. I did years back tear my esophagus from purging. This was scary. I stopped purging for a good amount of time out of fear, but it didn't stop me for good. 

Everyday I wake up hating myself and I willing harm myself. My body is damaged and I can't repair it perfectly. Yet I continue to damage it everyday. 

I think I'm rambling on here now so I'll stop, I hope that answered in part what you're looking for. I'm always open to questions. ",AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1

No drugs tho. I was failing classes left and right and also when I was 16 my sister was born (from dad and his gf) and she gave me a guiding light, she was my sunshine when my skies were gray.

daaaaanadolores,"I had a voluntary hospitalization stay in February of 2014. I was absolutely terrified, worrying that I'd end up in a padded room or being strapped down by some sadistic nurses or something, but it was not nearly as scary as I had imagined.

I think there were only 20 beds on the psychiatric ward, which I didn't expect. The day I checked myself in, there were no available beds, so they tried to bus me to a nearby hospital (I live in NYC, so there's a ton) and, at one point, the psychiatrist on call in the ER told me I had no choice but to go where they sent me. Thankfully, the nurse told me the shrink was lying, and if I stood my ground, they couldn't send me anywhere. So, I spent Day 1 sleeping on a stretcher in a shared room until a bed freed up in the psych ward, which thankfully only took a day to happen.

After you sign some documents acknowledging that you're submitting yourself for a voluntary hospitalization, they take your stuff away. I don't know if it works this way at every hospital, but they did an inventory of my stuff and put it in a safe. I was allowed to keep my phone, but the psych staff kept the charger behind the nurses station to keep you from hanging yourself with it. I wasn't allowed to wear my own clothes until the psych staff deemed it ""safe,"" so I was stuck in a hospital gown and socks for two days (this probably wouldn't be as big of an issue for anyone else, but I signed myself in for anorexia, so it's not like I had a lot of body fat to spare, and it was in the middle of a blizzard). 

I had a roommate in the psych ward, and if I'm not mistaken, all of the rooms were two-person, with the exception of a single one-person room for people with physical disabilities who needed the accommodations. Each bedroom had an attached bathroom. Then, there was the ""dining room"" (I spent no time in here, because I refused to eat unless I was allowed to do so in my bedroom), a game room, an ""art therapy"" room, and a standard psychologist's office. None of the doors had locks, but we were allowed to close the doors at will, and people generally respected your privacy. I was *very* antisocial during my entire stay--I slept nearly the entire time--and all the patients respected that. At night, the staff does checks to make sure you haven't killed yourself while your roommate is sleeping, but they just shine a flashlight into the room to see if you're still breathing. 

I wasn't suicidal, but my roommate was, which meant that she was on 1-to-1 (she was assigned a nurse who had to watch her all the time) for the first day. I also have a lot of physical health problems, many of which are related to my anorexia, so at least once every hour, a nurse would ask me, ""Are you in any pain?"" which got really fucking annoying, but I know they were just doing their jobs.

I can't speak about the group therapy or anything, because I refused to participate. In retrospect, I'm sure I was actually such a pain in the ass to the staff: I didn't eat in the dining room, I didn't do art therapy or meditation or any of that, I didn't even get up when I was supposed to. It's not because I was against it; I was just so fucking tired and I just needed a break. I'm actually really happy that they respected that and just let me sleep.

After day 4, I think, it became very clear to me that I didn't belong in the psych ward, because the staff didn't specialize in eating disorders, which is what I so desperately needed to be treated (I have depression, anxiety, dissociation, and all that shit, too, but the eating disorder was literally killing me day by day). And this is where I had an issue: After signing yourself in, you can't just waltz out of the psych ward; the doctors can hold you for 72 hours after you request to check yourself out, and if they deem you a threat to yourself or others, they can petition a court to keep you *in* the hospital. The staff agreed I wasn't a threat, but they were hesitant to let me out, I think because I was such an outspoken pain in the ass who swore a lot and questioned every decision they made (it's my nature). Thankfully, the head psychiatrist specialized in eating disorders and very clearly realized I needed different treatment, so I didn't have to wait the full 72 hours to get out. She referred me to a couple of treatment centers in the area, and started the paperwork for me. She saved me.

I hope this was kind of helpful. I know it's scary. It's so scary. I was barely 19 when I checked myself in, and I was so afraid everyone else would be older and crazier and violent or something. But most of the people there were just normal people. They were nice. No one did anything obscene. I was just so out of control, and I needed a break. I needed to sleep. I needed someone else to make the decisions for me.

Anorexia in cats is dangerous because after a while of not eating they can develop a condition called 'hepatic lipidosis'.

If your cat continues to not eat she might need to have a feeding tube.

A few tricks for getting an anorexic cat to eat. Don't put food in their face all of the time, if they are feeling nauseated it will put them off eating. So try to offer food say 4/5 times a day but only persist for 10-20 minutes at a time.

You can warm the food (obviously not too hot) in the microwave. It makes it a bit more smelly and more appetising.

You could also get one of the more liquid foods and try to syringe feed however please be VERY careful because there is a risk of getting food in the lungs (aspiration pneumonia) which can be fatal. So ideally please discuss with your vet before going this route. They can also provide a suitable food. Something like hills a/d. Good luck!",AskVet,t5_2sx1m,1

birdsofterrordise,"Oh love, you don't understand the healthcare system doesn't include mental healthcare. There were lifetime caps on mental healthcare coverage which were very commonly only about 10k. For your lifetime. Wouldn't be bad if visits cost like $5, but one in patient stay for a patient with anorexia for  a few days can EASILY exhaust the lifetime coverage amount, without the continuing therapy maxed out. This is partially why medication for mental disorders is so popular, even though CBT and other therapies are actually way more effective- seeing a therapist costs lots and lots of money. And god help you  if you need inpatient. 

As for guidance counselors, most of them are trained to do college application work (ha) but really, they simply don't have the time. The school may have 1 or 2 for 1000 students or in smaller schools, part time. They often have to triage so major behavioral issues or abuse reports that require a social worker's involvement may take up a lot of their time. They also have to go professional development and meetings constantly, so again, little time in the day to actually counsel.

As far as nurse's go, nice suburban schools have school nurses every day. In my urban district, most schools only have a nurse 2-3 times a week. And I bet you're wondering who dispenses medication for students. The secretary. Because the principal is usually too busy. In Philadelphia last year, [two students died](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/another-student-dies-school-no-nurse) from not having access to a school nurse who knew what issues were going on. Both children died on days a nurse was not there. A nurse who is trained to recognize signs and emergency situations. Trust me, we gamble plenty with children's lives and that still didn't stop our governor from cutting school budgets, specifically in the poor districts (we got cut about 18% of our budget, while the nice schools down the street got only 2-3% cut.)

Doctor_Arkham,"Oh, holy shit. In high school, so this might seem petty to the more seasoned of redditors, but definitely pissed me off to no end. 

This guy had previously hung around the stoner/partying/major asswipe group of kids. (Nothing against non-asshole stoners.)  For whatever reason, they excommunicated him, or he left, or whatever. I knew him through water polo, so he decided to follow me and my friends around. They're pretty hesitant, knowing his reputation, but I convince them to just give the guy a shot. So, knowing that we all liked variations of alternative or surf rock, he decides to overcompensate by trying to become as fair away from mainstream as possible. If it has been played on the radio, it is automatically TERIBBLE in his eyes. So two or three friends of this approximately five person group are into bands like Panic! At The Disco, Fall Out Boy, blink-182, Modest Mouse, etc. Personally, I liked Fall Out Boy a lot. So naturally, he harassed anyone who said that they were a good band, insisting that everyone who didn't listen to Celtic metal had to have terrible taste in music- INCLUDING a girl he wanted to sleep with. Not that big of a deal to want to sleep with someone in high school, right? Wrong. This girl was a super diligent student, really caring, very innocent, and covered up any pains she had by being nice to everyone.
Enter asshole friend, who begins asking me to try to set them up for a date. I politely inform him I've actually had feelings for her for the past two years, and am pursuing a relationship with her. He appears to understand and backs off. After I set up my plans to ask her to homecoming and ask for his help, one of our mutual friends got uncomfortable and pulled me aside, informing me that best friend over there had already asked her behind my back and they were dating now. One argument later and I went home, feeling sick to my stomach. However, after talking to said girl, she says nothing of the kind happened. I confronted my friend about it, and his plan was revealed to be to trick me into thinking that she was taken so no one else would be asking her to homecoming, therefore taking her for himself. Whatever, says me, people do crazy things for love. Up until he asks me to help him get in one of her friends pants, at which point I was infuriated. Basically ignoring the girl he claimed to be crazy about, so much so that he'd step on a friend to do it. I get pissed about it, and he says, ""fine, I won't ask her."" (Later on, he tried dating her again, but once again cut his attempts short when he decided he'd rather try to sleep with my ex girlfriend. He earned his water polo nickname Pathetic Man-Whore.) He also started bringing his Norwegian metal friends into the drama room, which is precisely where I used to go to get away from him. He couldn't stop there, oh no. He decided to invite my other ex girlfriend to come along after school. I ended up hanging out in a closet for a while waiting for her to leave, and praying that the girl who fucked me over emotionally hadn't just seen me jump into a closet. Because, you know, high school logic. At this point, most of my friends just want to be around the ""cool guy"" in the room, and my depression worsened. There are so many stories, but I think I can just leave it at his insecurities and desire to be above everyone else, which was basically the aforementioned getting me mocked for listening to the music I liked by the people who used to like the same stuff, called a girl i dated who'd had to leave to a mental hospital for anorexia and depression ""a fat whore"", coming to my house and rubbing his junk on everything in my room, trying to get in my OTHER friend's ex's pants, calling me a jealous, over sensitive dick for getting mad that he was trying to fuck a girl I used to be crazy in high school love with, more along those lines.

cherebelle86,"I've been struggling with bulimia for around four years after gaining (what I thought was too much) weight in recovery from anorexia.  For me, it's the same emotional struggle.  Feeling out of control and so I try to control what I can.  Binging - out of control, purging - in control.  Every time I feel the urge to binge, I remind myself that despite my emotions telling me otherwise, I am in control of my binging.  When I binge, that is my choice.  Accepting that fact, helps me prevent a binge (and therefore a purge because I typically only purge after a binge).  It's not always successful but its one of the coping mechanisms that has really helped me.  I always really disliked calling a friend, go for a walk, etc because it's not helpful at midnight.  

If you are not in an area where you can find professional treatment, I highly recommend using online resources.  The resources listed in the side panel of this subreddit are really good.  There are also online therapy sources (though I don't know access in countries outside the US).  I've heard good things about 7 Cups of Tea (http://www.7cupsoftea.com/) which is anonymous.  Ed-bites is another great blog/information website (http://edbites.com/).  Developing a strong coping mechanism bank is also really beneficial (http://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/recovery/self-help-tools-skills-tips/effective-coping-for-eating-disorders).  

Another thing that I (try) to do is to delay five minutes.  I wait five minutes, at the end of five minutes, I re-evaluate and decide if I want to b/p (and I keep going in five minute intervals until I'm no longer thinking about it).  Part of this technique is blanket permission that if I decide to b/p, I can.  Eating disorder behavior (at least for me) becomes more enticing, the more I try to forbid it.",EatingDisorders,t5_2qpcj,2

This is a clinical symptom and definition of anorexia.  Anorexia is not about losing weight.  Losing weight happens because of anorexia, but that's not why anorexics don't eat.  Largely, they don't eat because they want to be in control of their hunger.

Lil_Boots1,"Either way, this is something to discuss with your doctor since its been going on for 6 months. If you have the mental illness anorexia nervosa, which it sounds like could be an issue based on your need for control and your enjoyment from controlling your hunger, then you need a diagnosis and treatment. If it's a matter of you not feeling hungry, which is actually just plain anorexia, then that loss of appetite can itself be a clinical symptom of something more serious. 

And you can do some serious damage to your body with severe caloric restriction before you become clinically underweight, so it's worth talking to someone about sooner rather than later. You should also know that while body dysmorphia is common in patients with anorexia nervosa, the primary driver of the disease is typically the need for control, and you don't have to have body dysmorphia to be anorexic. It's also common for people with eating disorders to have an obsession with food and cooking and then not eat it. 

Also, stress can decrease your appetite by itself and it can trigger unhealthy coping mechanisms like restricting food intake on purpose. I totally understand being too busy for a real meal, and I keep those cups of soup that Campbell's makes where you drink the soup out of the cup in my cubicle because no one can afford a meltdown because I've been in the lab for 10 hours without food.

After at least thirty texts, calls, emails, etc. to her family, I finally found out where she had gone.  I wanted to let her know that I was there for her, and to have something warm and familiar in her dorm room, so I sewed her name onto a pillow, and then sewed her favorite quote on the back; ""Life is hard, but so very beautiful""--Abraham Lincoln.

mcnuggetskitty,"I would say that you certainly have some disordered eating habits/attitudes, but I'm not qualified to say if it's an actual eating disorder. Diagnostically, for eating disorders, there's 4 categories: Anorexia (you don't meet the DSM criteria for that, but neither did I when I was hospitalized for an eating disorder, for the sole reason that I still got my period, so not being diagnostically anorexic doesn't always mean a whole lot; bulimia, which you don't meet the criteria for (again, neither did I, because I didn't binge enough even though I vomited 10-20 times a day); binge eating disorder, and eating disorder not otherwise specified (when there's definitely a clinical eating disorder but you don't meet all of the criteria for the other three).

I wasn't that concerned until you mentioned that you like being in control of your hunger. This sets off all kinds of warning bells for me, but not for the reasons most people have. Eating disorders can be ""about"" many things, sometimes control is one of them, sometimes it isn't. But the way you phrased it tells me there is a problem. ""Giving in"" to your body's signals of hunger isn't a weakness. It's funny how people think ""I have a body"" rather than ""I *am* a body"". Your body is telling you that you aren't caring for yourself properly. Listen to it. Feeling pride about overriding your body's instinctual needs for things like sustenance is a major red flag. An anorectic's daily calorie intake often seems normal to them. The body sometimes shuts down hunger signals when it thinks it's starving. There's a ton of other awful things that happen within your body when it believes there's a famine and it must make do with what little it is given.

One of my favorite books is ""Wasted"" by Marya Hornbacher. It's a memoir of her eating disorder, and I see a lot of similarities between your words and hers. As someone who has had a severe eating disorder, I also find it to be one of the most honest portrayals of them that I have ever seen. Don't let yourself get any deeper into these patterns and attitudes. See a therapist that specializes in eating issues and see a nutritionist to find out what your body needs to keep you alive and thriving. Don't let yourself get to the point of no return.

Ihaveafatcat,"I feel like that would be annoying if it were any type of media though, like if your family member posted three buzzfeed articles every day, ie it's not to do with selfies but just spam, really. And yet most of the selfie criticism I see specifically mentions 'vanity' and 'narcissism' and 'DAE me generation?!' Which is just sad to me because honestly, out of the friends I have on Facebook, the ones who post the most selfies are not at all the ones who come across as self-obsessed and vain. Often I think it's a sign of low self-esteem. It's old news that we live in a world where there's more pressure than ever before to look absolutely perfect. Women especially are constantly bombarded with photoshopped, professionally-taken photos of celebrities and models, and now we have the technology to take nice photos of ourselves, and feel good about ourselves, and they call us vain? Being able to take selfies on my phone improved my self esteem more than anything else ever has. And going back to Facebook, the girl who posts the most selfies in my friends list is actually recovering from severe anorexia, and I think it's fucking awesome that she now has the confidence to post pictures of herself, when before she couldn't even look in the mirror. I just don't at all get the mindset of criticising someone for being HAPPY with how they look. Spamming up your newsfeed? Sure. But criticising them for selfies in particular... I just don't get that. 

I just feel like the selfie-critical crowd is just very indicative of the culture visible in the OP article, and also in how people reacted to 'the fappening'. Females exist to be adored by everyone but themselves. Just look at the difference in reactions stolen photos from the fappening got to Kim Kardashian's 'break the internet' photos. The former were not consensual, and everyone loved them. The latter were consensual, and everyone criticised them for being too revealing, too vain, too attention-seeking.

You feel like you are walking on eggshells with a girl you care about and I can only imagine how difficult that it. If she happens to be seeing a therapist maybe you can throw out the idea of going to a session with her? Just make sure she understands that you want to go not because you want to tattle on her or attack her in anyway. Tell her you want to understand what she is going through as much as you can and that you think it would benefit your relationship to be apart of her treatment process. I think that if one of my boyfriends came to me like that I would have considered it. 

If she's not in therapy I still think it's important to have a conversation about this modeling thing. When you talk to her try to say things like, ""This situation makes me feel..."" or ""I'm feeling nervous about this because...""  
When you make it about YOUR feelings about her well being and talk calmly hopefully she will respond better.

As someone who was also a victim of teenaged rape and then was later in a sexually abusive domestic situation for a couple years, I want to say something more than just congratulations: **expect to be an emotional disaster, forgive yourself for being an emotional disaster (it's not your fault!), and work your ass off at fixing your mental health, because there is no chance it has not been severely impacted by these horrible crimes** that were visited upon you. 

&amp;nbsp;

I spent 10 years or so NOT dealing with my mental health, and they were miserable years- I was never suicidal, but I frequently knowingly put myself in situations that could have easily led to death, at the very least more rape. Something happens to you when you undergo this kind of trauma. Because of it, you are in danger of generating more trauma for yourself in the form of unhealthy sexual relationships and possible substance abuse, among other things. For example, I developed anorexia that lasted for a couple years after both of the above traumas. Additionally, I highly doubt I would have dated an abusive partner had I not previously been the victim of a sex crime- sexual abuse can lead to further sexual abuse, which further confirms your suspicions that all men really just want to rape you- they don't! But you can't just know that intellectually- your body has to know it. Mine had to unlearn reactions to being touched. A perfectly safe man, a man I'd consented to sexual activity with, would touch me, and I'd just submit to him, and then my mind would disappear from my body. You can't just will this kind of thing away- it's a conditioned reaction. 

&amp;nbsp;

You may not deal with these particular things, but I assure you, there will be something. I encourage anyone who has suffered regular abuse to get therapy- there is no way in hell you don't need it! How could you not? Repeated attacks cause physiologically conditioned responses that are involuntary.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, you CAN be happy after unspeakable traumas, but it's bloody unlikely to just **happen** all by itself, or even with just the support of friends and family. Expect to suffer endlessly if you don't do something proactive to heal yourself, and maintain it. Pain this big needs more than just time to heal. If you don't deal with it, I'll be honest, it's hard to imagine your life going well. That feeling you speak of of feeling like you can't do anything right, while it isn't true, may become true if you don't work hard on healing yourself- being repeatedly raped by your father is likely to decrease your overall emotional functionality.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, maybe you're stronger than me and are perfectly fine emotionally, but I can tell you right now that that's amazing and rare, and it's more likely you are just in denial. Don't be ashamed that you're messed up- you didn't mess you up, life messed you up. But you are young, and you are fixable. All these people are saying that you are strong, and they're proud of you, and that's all fine and wonderful and true, but your work isn't done. You can't stop being strong and coddle yourself- if you just hide away miserably from the world and your problems, you will live in a world defined by those problems. You have to create a new world for yourself that is defined by what you want from your life, and each day take steps towards it. Seeing a regular therapist is the first step, and one you need to stick to. Then you need to start empowering yourself by figuring out what you want to do with your life and just fucking doing it. You can take baby steps, but if you don't take any steps, all is lost.

&amp;nbsp;

However, I want to offer some hope. I am living proof that you can be fine. I'm in a very happy relationship, about to apply to a program to become a medical professional, and I generally feel safe in the world(!), something that wasn't true AT ALL before I got therapy. It takes time and effort, but with those things, this doesn't have to ruin your life. Now, I am not going to say that what I experienced is anywhere near as horrifying as what happened to you, but I will say that I was pretty fucking screwed up, and I can only hope that if I can make it out, then so can you. Get therapy. A lot of it. It's so worth it. Please please please do your best to fix your broken heart, and please understand that you aren't the one who broke it. No one blames you for it, except for that crazy lady at your dad's hearing- she is likely someone who also underwent sexual trauma at some point too who is very, very unstable and in some kind of very messed up relationship with your father. Like I said above, sexual trauma begets more sexual trauma if you don't deal with it. This woman did a horrible thing being angry at you, but I imagine she deserves to be pitied more than hated..

cyaxares,"Do you have a suitable subject to be obsessed about?

I obsess over Latin (which I major in). This subject is a perfect target for my obsession for several reasons: 

* Great for self-study. When it comes to the acquisition of bare language skills (as opposed to literary theories etc.) professors are usually not much of a help and definitely not required. To get better at reading at Latin I just read Latin. I'm not going to run out of texts to read for the rest of my life. To get better at composing Latin I read Latin and then try to reproduce/imitate what I have read. To get better at speaking Latin I just talk to myself. 

* Language learning doesn't require great intelligence, just a lot of practice. The biggest idiot of 50 BC had an infinitely better grasp of Latin than I do. This is very encouraging imo, basically a guarantee of success. Put in the hours and sooner or later you'll get the results. 

* I get very direct feedback by keeping track of the number of pages/lines of verse I read per hour. Half a year ago I read Cicero at 6-8 pages/hour, now I consistently read 10+ pages/hour. Everything I learn today is something I won't have to look up or think about when I run across it tomorrow.           
There are compounding effects that make improvement very satisfying: the less words you are unfamiliar with, the more of the remaining unfamiliar words you'll understand from context; more experience leads to faster reading, faster reading leads to more text covered, more text covered leads to more experience; ...

* Most Latin students are quite bad at Latin. Feels good when people come to you for advice.

* There's a small group of obsessive Latin students to measure myself against. Most of us having left their sanity at the door (for the girls it's anorexia &amp; OCD, for the boys it's more varied) we make each other a bit crazy about how little we know and all the things we really should do to improve and that prevents us all from slacking off. 

* Practically no skill ceiling, especially when it comes to composition. 

My other major (Theology) would be less suitable for this kind of obsession as feedback would be much less direct and progress a lot less visible (so you become ""good"" at Patristics? I don't even know what that would mean but in any case it won't help you very much in all the other sub-disciplines that collectively account for 90% of your course of studies).

So maybe look around in the disciplines your major entails with an eye towards which ones might make good targets for obsession. Think less in terms of ""obsessing over school in general"" and more in terms of ""obsessing over a particular subject"".",ForeverAlone,t5_2s3yz,2

LePew_was_a_creep,"I think, as a society, we joke a lot about eating disorders without ever seeing the nastiness and pain that is associated with them. So it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking having an ED is something to almost admirable. On some level anorexia is often used interchangeably with extreme dieting (not just here, but as a broader societal misconception). I had a very dear friend of mine suffer from it and I genuinely worried she might die, as somewhere between 5 and 20 percent of people with anorexia do. She hated herself and it dominated every aspect of her life. When I think of an eating disorder, I think of seeing her ribs through her skin and worrying that her body might be digesting her heart - which is what happens when your body is starving. 

But I've heard a lot of people (not specific to this sub, but all over in my life) use anorexic as a synonym for thin and self-concerned or vain about it. And I think that's probably part where part of seeing anorexia as desirable comes from. People think about the weight loss, but they don't think about the fact that it's a lethal mental illness. I don't want to make you feel guilty or anything, I just wanted to shine light on the contrast between the societally driven admiration for women who can lose a lot of weight, and the painful reality of having an eating disorder.",raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,4

PandaBroham,"It annoys me that VS models get shit for being ""skinny"".  Some people seems to have the misconception that the models don't eat at all in order to look the way they do, but it's a combination of a healthy (admittedly strict) diet and exercise.  It's visible that the models are incredibly toned, which is the look they're going for when modeling lingerie.

If you look at it in a different light, these models are basically professionals at looking good.  They're paid to work out and eat healthy so that they can do their best to model underwear and bikinis.  They need sex appeal and a nice body in order to sell these things.  

Yes, VS models are thin, but if you compared them to models that suffer from anorexia, there's a clear difference. VS models are healthy, and most likely strong from the toning and cardio exercises that they do.  How do you think they walk around on 6 inch heels and 20lbs worth of metal wings? 

Personally, I think that VS models work hard for their bodies, as well as being naturally endowed.  Good looks will only get you so far though, because toned flat stomachs like theirs do not come naturally.

But I know that if an alcoholic was offered a drink and refused they would have had to use a great deal more willpower than me.

It was a long road to recovery, but it is worth the battle and the beautiful thing is that you will learn a lot about yourself along the way. 

Two books I recommend:
-Eating in the Light of the Moon - very specific to females, but as a male I was able to really connect with a lot of the author's (a recovered anorexic) struggles and triumphs. 
-The Power of Now - a 'spirituality' book that focuses on our literal presence on this planet, and accepting it and being a part of it peacefully. Really helped me stop judging myself, but that struggle never really ends for anyone, whether or not they have an eating disorder.

BEST OF LUCK AND MUCH LOVE!

iiRenity,"I want to say that I am so so sorry for the diagnosis. My baby Freya was diagnosed in mid August, and by the middle of October we decided that it was time to put her to sleep. When she originally was diagnosed, we had the fluid drained from her and it did help improve her disposition. This returned her to almost normal for not quite a month. However, there is no cure for this disease and the fluid will come back.

Freya also began to have episodes where she would drool excessively and seem to zone out where she was not quite aware of where she was and who she was with. This made her hiss at us on ocassion. When she had these episodes the best thing for her was for us to lay with her or have her in our lap and gentle stroke her. This started happening because the disease was making its progression to the brain and she was having small seizures that we didn't catch until our vet advised us to watch for them when we described her episodes.

FIP can also cause anorexia. Freya would start refusing food and water during her episodes; we knew when she was ""coming out of it"" because she'd start eating food.

I am sorry to tell you that there's really nothing that can be done but to make him as comfortable as possible. I fed Freya nothing but wet meow mix cups because that was her favorite, we gave her temptations treats by the handful, we spoiled her with cat nip toys and she never left my side when I was at home. I started carrying her and helping her up when she became too bloated to jump. I also began to let her outside. 

Every day I would take her out into the yard on her leash and let her frolick as much as she wanted in the dirt and grass and leaves. I didn't hold the leash, it was just there for just in case. I took a hundred pictures and videos of her.

Finally, we noticed that her seizures and episodes were coming more frequent. She was refusing food more often. We took her for two vet visits in the month of October. Once in the beginning of October, to give her a check up on the progression. She had lost a lot of weight. She was five pounds, if that. The second visit was after a long discussion between  my boyfriend and I. We noticed the bloating beginning again, we noticed the increased of seizures and lethargy.

We had promised Freya that when we noticed she was suffering and when she told us it was time that we'd do what needed to be done. The night before she stopped breathing for several moments at different times in the night. We took her in, the vet checked her out. She had gained five pounds in fluid in those few weeks and she agreed with us that we were in the right. We kissed her and held her through the procedure.

It was very gentle and very peaceful. They gave her a strong sedative and placed her in my arms (we brought her favorite blanket to wrap her in so she would smell her home), I held her paw until she fell asleep. Then they placed her on the table, gave her the shot that she didn't feel while I continued holding her paw. She passed immediately. The vet and I think that she was ready enough to go that she probably actually passed during sedation. It was heart breaking, but I know it was the right thing to do.

Spoil your baby. Give him his favorite wet food, let him play outside with you, hold him and pet him as much as he wants, take pictures and videos so you can use them to help you cope, and when it comes time do what you feel you must for your baby. The wet food will really help when the anorexia and food pickiness starts in. I fed her whenever she asked for it, because she couldn't keep the weight on.

I went through a terrible phase myself when out son who was 14 at the time, and I found my husband dead. I had flashbacks and nightmares. I was diagnosed with PTSD. I started abusing my pain medication from Lupus and fybermialgia to keep me awake. I stayed awake without food for a week give or take at a time. I passed out from exhaustion flat on my face on my tile floor and woke up a bloody mess. I'm blessed I'm not dead from an overdose or from collapsing. I was trying to avoid the nightmares and flashbacks by not sleeping. I went from a size 14 to a size 0 and looked like the poster child for anorexia. 
Things are better. I don't have many nightmares or flashbacks much. I pray things will get better for you all also. I know the desperation for sleep. Alcohol only made my problems worse as the drugs complicated my life as well as my family's. 
I wish you all the best. But please don't turn to alcohol. Once you cross that invisible line into alcoholism, there's no going back. I can't celebrate special occasions without worrying if I'll be able to stop again. And when I do drink the few times a year, I do find it very difficult to not resume doing it on a daily basis when I can't stop until I pass out. It's a terrible life and a even more terrible way to die as I watched it consume my father that was once a 'functional alcoholic' and an engineer at IBM until he retired at 48 years old. Could have had a great life, until he became dysfunctional and died leaving me, his only child and young grandchildren and my husband with terrible memories and the aftermath.

How my father still loved her years after their divorce (the divorce he initiated, and she still bragged about it years after he married an awesome woman)

How she didn't have any friends (""if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve to be my friend."" for real. You can't make this shit up)

How she always got a BIG return on her taxes (that my sister was forced to file)

OH! Here's a great one- All she had to do to get out of getting us (kids) vaccinated was claim religious exemption! 

How her genes are what made GC such a great runner (GC is also NC with Nmom- even the GC had it bad enough to never look back...)

How she had such a boyish figure

How she used to do drugs in high school

How she used to skip class and go hang out with boys

How she had a line of men just waiting for her to say 'yes' (as a grey-haired, middle aged, woman with seriously blotchy skin and receding gums. No missing teeth, but you could tell.)

How various (now married) ex-boyfriends still pined over her.

How that server/cashier/busboy/whatever- was looking at her, and how the only reason they weren't going to ask her on a date because she was with her kids... heh. I still get a kick out of the time one of the guys who was 'flirting' with her slipped me his number.

Quietuus,"I've done a fairly large amount of research on the issue myself, but I come to it from a more political and social issues stance. There are enough dissenting voices, ill-fitting data and deficiencies in studies for me to have serious doubts about both the prevalance and effects of obesity, particularly when we talk about people at the lower end of what is now considered obese (a definition category which has expanded quite dizzily over the last 20-30 years). I also seriously worry that particularly for a lot of people in this lower band (or those trying to avoid it) the mental and physical toll wrought by body image issues and haphazard attempts to control weight is going to do more damage than weight. One factor that we know exacerbates almost every other health condition and shortens the human life span is stress. Anywhere from 10-20 million plus Americans (depending on which figures you look at) suffer from eating disorders, a number which is growing. The long term and short term health effects of anorexia nervosa particularly are extremely serious; much worse than being somewhat overweight. I mean, it kills 15-20% of the people who have it according to long-range studies. Bulimia and other eating disorders are nice only by comparison. I also worry to what extent our cultural dialogues against fat produce medical harm; I'm sure if you've researched the issue you'll probably have come across the papers about how people who are considered overweight tend to access medical care less, how they are overdiagnosed or underdiagnosed certain conditions, how they are given the wrong doses for medication, refused treatment (and in the US refused health insurance) more often (often for little good clinical reason) and so on. I believe that these are inevitable consequences of treating obesity as an epidemic disease; as is the exaggerated fear of contagion you often see in reddit fat-haters, who seem to fear that those who would try and live with fat (particularly) are some sort of diabolical social cancer. Fat isn't contagious, it's not an illness to be fought with the efficiency of a military campaign; it's a very visible (and somewhat erratic) single indicator of health, diet and so on. The decision to treat it as an epidemic, to highlight its dangers, to focus on *this* problem specifically over so many others (particularly less visible problems like mental health generally) seems to me to be obviously a political matter. The treatment of fat people as sufferers from an epidemic disease tends to enable their dehumanisation, both in terms of the medical profession and ultimately in terms of subs like /r/fatpeoplehate.",Negareddit,t5_2vsbl,2

uliarliarpantsonfire,"I would say first off to make sure that they understand how you've lost weight. I think sometimes weight loss in a person is scary if you don't understand how they are losing it. There is a lot of awareness about anorexia and bulimia now, which is great, but I think people are more watchful and get worried if they don't know how you lost the weight. My sister was concerned that there was such a difference in just my pictures (we live across the country) and had a minor freak out. I sent her the link to MFP and talked about what I eat and how it is working. She was relieved but still thinks I eat too much cauliflower. :)

If they are aware how you've done it and that you are eating healthy amounts then ask them what specifically their concerns are and why they feel you've changed. It may be that your activities were food centered before and now you are turning down those invites to limit exposure to temptation. It might even be unrelated to any of that, maybe you are stressed about work or something else and they see the weight loss and attribute the stress to it. 

If none of that is the case and they can't give you a reasonable reason for concern then I'd say it's their problem.

SgtMac02,"&gt; Why is this considered unhealthy

If your doctors are ok with it, then I guess its not. It sounds unhealthy as it doesn't sound like it has enough nutritional diversity. But as I said in the conversation with your husband...what do I know? I'm no nutritionist, I'm, just another asshole on the internet. Also, as I said to him, I'm genuinely curious what meal replacement bars you're eating that are both nutritional enough to be OKed by your doctor and filling enough to allow you to eat the way you're eating. This is not any sort of accusation, it is genuine interest. 

&gt;I'm sorry if I can't give enough background info to make all of reddit to believe I'm legit,

I think the basis for this issue was that your initial claim of your spending sounds really unbelievable to most people. Maybe the cost of food is way cheaper in your college town, and you work way harder than most at being frugal. Also, what you consider ""eating well/healthy"" is not a diet for most of your average people. Your chosen diet is far cheaper than what most people would subsist on. Basically....while YOU might be able to afford to live/eat that way, it's really pretty far from average. Your original post sort of sounded like you thought that the amount you spent on groceries was relatively normal, and it's really not for most people. For the record, I never claimed that you couldn't live on the amount of food you were getting for the amount you were spending. I did (unnecessarily harshly) call you a liar in regards to your claims of eating ""healthy"" based on what I saw in your comment history about your diet. It really doesn't sound ""healthy"". But I have retracted that unwarranted insult. I still think that most doctors would not call that a healthy diet. Some might OK it, but it really doesn't sound ""healthy"".  Livable? Sure. Not going to cause negative impacts? Ok. But not a recommended healthy plan, I'm thinking. 

Oh and this one:
&gt;And as long as I'm losing weight isn't that what matters ?

No, not by a long shot. In your case, if your doctors are ok with your approach, sure. But that statement in and of itself is a really dangerous thought, I'm sure you're aware. There are lots of REALLY unhealthy ways you could be losing weight. And for some people, just the fact that they are losing weight at all is unhealthy (anorexia for example). So, no...just ""as long as I'm losing weight""  is NOT what matters. What matters is losing an appropriate amount of weight in a healthy manner.

I can imagine that for some people it is indeed a serious problem that they need to be alert for and that they need to learn to handle, and that it is not easy. However, going to the opposite side of the spectrum, and making oneself unhealthy by overeating, is not the answer, which is what these people fail to realise.

itsmyotherface,"&gt;they were formerly anorexic, and yet, they believe they can't control their weight?

My 2 cents (which do not necessarily apply to the people who post to TiTP). 

Going from anorexic to obese is really just swinging from one end of the disordered eating scale to another. When you are in recovery, part of this recovery centers around body acceptance. To see examples of the types of affirmations you are given, you have to go no further than FA websites. A lot of eating disorder recovery stuff has been co-opted by the FA movement. 

So what you're basically learning a few things, the main things (IMO) are that: 

1) You can't control everything. (control plays a huge part in anorexia). 

2) Body acceptance/self esteem.

3) A healthy relationship with food. 

Everyone has things that come easier than others. I think that sometimes when people have (truly) starved themselves, once you get that self-permission to eat----you turn into a garbage disposal. The ""healthy relationship with food"" was never established (for whatever reason).

resurrectedlawman,"Worse than that, though. Those are two mutually incompatible beliefs. 

If you believe your weight is literally beyond your control, and has nothing to do with your eating behavior (""genetics!""), then you would never be an anorexic -- because anorexia is founded on the belief that restricting your food intake will change your body weight. Similarly, if you're worried about anorexia, then you *must* know that restricting food will cause you to get dangerously thin -- in which case, you absolutely cannot believe that there is no connection between eating and body mass.

Either fat is caused by how much you eat or it isn't. Anorexics believe it is, and ""genetics"" folks believe it isn't.

lardloather,"The real number will be much higher, the 145 are those who have the cause of death/causal factor listed as anorexia, -
Although eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental disorder,  the mortality rates reported on those who suffer from eating disorders can vary considerably between studies and sources. Part of the reason why there is a large variance in the reported number of deaths caused by eating disorders is because those who suffer from an eating disorder may ultimately die of heart failure, organ failure, malnutrition or suicide. Often, the medical complications of death are reported instead of the eating disorder that  compromised a person’s health.
(http://www.anad.org/get-information/about-eating-disorders/eating-disorders-statistics/)

the cost can be huge (but not anywhere near the cost of obesity of course)-
Treatment of an eating disorder in the US ranges from $500 per day to $2,000 per day. The average cost for a month of inpatient treatment is $30,000. It is estimated that individuals with eating disorders need anywhere from 3 – 6 months of inpatient care. Health insurance companies for several reasons do not typically cover the cost of treating eating disorders
The cost of outpatient treatment, including therapy and medical monitoring, can extend to $100,000 or more",fatpeoplehate,t5_2x9xz,2

georgiajane1,"Thank you so much for your supportive comments :) I thought I would share my story a little more in case anyone is wondering! 

My senior year of high school, I developed anorexia. I was eating 1200 calories a day at most and exercised obsessively. It was miserable- I was cold all the time, and food and calories were constantly on my mind. Finally I reached my goal weight, but as soon as I got to college something inside me snapped: I began binging at almost every meal, to the point that I was painfully full every time I ate. I felt so guilty and still was obsessing over everything I put in my mouth, but I couldn't stop eating all the foods I had deprived myself of for so long! I gained almost fifty pounds in the space of just a few months, which was pretty traumatic. None of my clothes fit anymore, and I hated myself for gaining all the weight back. But I was unable to get the binging under control, and soon I developed bulimia. I struggled with bulimia for almost two years, my weight going up and down every few months. 

As you can see, that was a pretty rough period in my life. But finally this past summer I decided to take control and get things back on track! I did Weight Watchers online for a few months and dropped about 10 lbs, which boosted my self-confidence in such a big way. Although I don't know if I would recommend it to anyone who has struggled with anorexia, since the ""points"" system was a little too close to my former obsessive calorie counting. However, it did teach me to be satisfied on less food, and it was great that I could eat as many fruits and veggies as I wanted! I think that really helped me with my binging.

But what has really changed my life these past couple months has been intuitive eating- no weight loss plan, just listening to my body and eating what makes me feel good. I have also been working out about 5 days a week (30 mins cardio, 30 mins weight exercises), which has helped me to tone up. But it feels so good to eat whatever I want again- even dessert (sometimes multiple times a day!) And even though switching to intuitive eating was scary at first, I haven't gained weight and my relationship with food has improved immensely. 

tl;dr: struggled with multiple eating disorders, but now intuitive eating has changed my life!

(Personally looking at clomipramine which seems to be the best progress I've had thus far. Thought different medications for different people and different outcomes.) With the right medication it can be easier to resist the compulsions. Even if its baby steps, like touching something your friend has touched for x amount of seconds and resist the compulsion to wash your hands for x amount of seconds and work your way up. Sorry if I'm just repeating things you've heard a million times, but this is the same advice I'm using to battle with my own OCD.

crackedpot11,"False. 2000 is the standard amount they use on packaging. A healthy diet can't be decided by calorie counting alone. You have to factor in your expenditure. For an overweight person, more calories are necessary to keep them functioning (breathing with fat on your chest, pumping blood to excessive amounts of skin and fat stores, the muscles required to stand up and support the weight). For a smaller person, 1500 is plenty. I consume about 1200. I'm 5'4"" and 110 lbs. When I dealt with anorexia nervosa, I kept it between 50-400 a day.

patienceinbee,"&gt;it seems to me that this isn't unlike a mental disorder of assumption (like anorexia) that should be treated/rehabilitated by promoting self-acceptance...and most definitely not celebrated!

Anorexia nervosa and bulimia, since you have drawn on this false comparison, harms one's body and could kill if the root causes are left unaddressed. Even so, anorexia and bulimia are sometimes a defiance against others trying to control one's body from the outside (such as telling a girl how to be pretty, how much weight to have/lose, etc).

Being trans isn't a mental disorder, it has never *been* a disorder, and even key major bodies of psychiatry, psychology, and psychotherapy have now all conceded this to be correct. If they are in consensus (even after years of the abusive therapies they used to experiment on with past trans people), then why *aren't* you in consensus with them? Because it squicks you?

For a trans person to have the right to control their reproductive bodies under their terms is the same debate (and reliant on the same medical technologies) that comes from the question of one's right to choose what they want to do for their own body in birth control and pregnancy terminations.

&gt;BUT I DON'T GET THIS.

You don't have to. There are many things in life where this will always be the case. Find acceptance in that, and you will find acceptance in others.

Sex isn't just between your legs, there are many secondary sexual characteristics, and yes, once undergoing hormone therapy these sexual characteristic change. A transgender woman's breasts will develop, or a transgender man's facial and body hair will start to grow and his voice deepen, there are all sorts of changes that will happen in terms of musculature and body fat redistribution, etc. Your sexual characteristics too are the way they are because of hormones.

ElectronicWanderlust,"Thank you for your concern, I'm indeed far more comfortable in my skin than I was at my heaviest.

I recognized that I had moved from one eating disorder (anorexia) to another (compulsive binging) and decided I needed to get healthy and change my relationship with food. 

I read stories like the one you posted and I recognize the addiction as a fellow addict. To me, at least, that's what eating disorders are: an addiction. Addicts generally know what they're doing to their bodies and psyche is wrong, but the allure of escaping their misery for even a second or two is so strong they do the bad behavior anyways.

First step of conquering an addiction is to admit you have one. So, I'm a food addict. My relationship with food is that I use it to punish (anorexia) or please (binge) myself to reflect my own insecurities and issues. I fully admit that and by doing so I can start building a healthier relationship to food and start to overcome my addiction.

It isn't easy. In fact, I relapsed and I'm working to get back on track. I was down mid-November to 145. I'm now back up to 165. I can blame travel, the holidays, etc. but the fact of the matter is that I made poor choices and allowed my addiction to get the best of me for a while.

Some people see this sub as a place of hate, or shaming, or what have you. I come here to read stories like yours and use it for motivation. I WAS a hamplanet. I have the ability to BE a hamplanet. But I'm CHOOSING a different path. This sub motivates me.

And I NEED that motivation. Sometimes its hard as fuck to keep going. Realizing that in 6 weeks I packed on 20 pounds is demotivating as hell. I know for a fact why the FA's say diets don't work. I'm living it right now. It's like walking uphill on a steep slope with rollerskates on sometimes.

The path of least resistance is to give up. To say ""Fuck this, I'm happy with my body!"" when I know for damn sure I'm not. So I remind myself  that the path of least resistance goes downhill. It sucks, but there's no other way out of hell than to keep climbing.",fatpeoplestories,t5_2vzax,6

&gt; Men, Women and Children follows the story of a group of high school teenagers and their parents as they attempt to navigate the many ways the internet has changed their relationships, their communication, their self-image, and their love lives. The film attempts to stare down social issues such as video game culture, anorexia, infidelity, fame hunting, and the proliferation of illicit material on the internet. As each character and each relationship is tested, we are shown the variety of roads people choose - some tragic, some hopeful - as it becomes clear that no one is immune to this enormous social change that has come through our phones, our tablets, and our computers.

PinkPanther4,"Hi :)

I'm a formerly overweight and former emotional eater with a long history of anxiety, suicidal thoughts and depression. I started losing weight and ended up developing an eating disorder that I didn't realise I had until it was anorexia and just kept getting worse. I'm currently facing forced inpatient care because of how severe the doctors think I am and I'm trying to gain weight to prove them wrong. My mind and relationship with food has been fucked up since 13, but I've made a small amount of progress in that area.

Other than that, I'm a quiet person who's socially awkward and interested in science and learning. I want to study medicine or biomedical science and I'm also a big music fan :) I'm a fan of the arts in general and I love movies, horror films and I have a thing for Disney and anime :) I like anything to do with lord of the rings as well.

I love animals and although I'm not allowed to exercise right now, I want to take up running and some martial arts :) thanks for introducing yourself.",fuckeatingdisorders,t5_34jzi,5

hopelessneurotic,"At first, I hated every moment of it. I did it because I had to, but every moment of it I was planning my relapse. The whole recovery process was just a temporary measure to appease the doctors and family members pleading for me to make a change. I'd like to say that the symptoms of starvation (purple fingernails, constant feeling of cold, thoughts entirely dominated by food, fainting spells) went away with the beginning of refeed, but they really just got worse. Food made me bloated and hurt my stomach like hell. I was constantly nauseated, and felt disgusted with myself all of the time. But soon, my body began to react. After months of starvation, I suddenly felt a huge urge to eat. And eat. And eat. I was hungry constantly, and the hunger was completely consuming. Relapse was now impossible, my body needed to EAT. Emotionally, this was awful. I felt like I was binging, and that I was just going to gain weight infinitely. But as I continued through the recovery process, I started noticing other changes. My brain began to process things at a normal pace, I was less depressed. I actually wanted to go out and see people and do things. I had energy and enthusiasm for life. I still to this day get the occasional extreme hunger, but this has really gone down with a regular meal plan. Certain foods (my ""fear foods"") and situations (eating around family members and friends) still give me anxiety, but through therapy and support groups I'm learning coping mechanisms to overcome those feelings. Really, I just feel better. So much better. Recovery is an amazing thing, and looking back at myself with anorexia I'm just sad that I wasted my first year of university with that disorder.",progresspics,t5_2sl0y,8

Anorexia is not just about how you look, for me it was about having that control. Even the negative aspects (cold hands, hair loss) sometimes gave me pleasure in a distorted way because I enjoyed the feeling that I had complete control over my intake. In a way, I felt like I was above hunger and that made me feel superhuman. A lot of recent studies show that starvation in anorexics also triggers a type of high, and I definitely experienced that as well.
In addition to this, I did feel fat, even when I was extremely underweight. It's hard to explain the mindset you're in when you're starving, but honestly I was completely indifferent about my health. I just thought I carried the weight badly and needed to lose it.",progresspics,t5_2sl0y,7

I've gained weight through the magic of a slowly aging metabolism, so I no longer get those comments, but even when I see other people called them, it hurts my feelings.  Because it hurts to have my body scrutinized and judged, but even further, because I know people who *do* struggle with eating disorders, and I've studied psychology.  It hurts to know my friends who have serious mental illnesses aren't being taken seriously, because their conditions are a joke to make fun of thin people.  It hurts to know that the heavier and average-sized people I know who struggle with these issues may never truly get help because they don't ""look"" bulimic.  It hurts that the people I know who are thin who have these issues may be believed, but will still be brushed aside.  It hurts that so many people with these problems have them stem from genetics, from poor self-esteem, from brain chemistry, from unhealthy home lives and relationships, but won't have those sources examined and treated seriously because everyone is caught up with these being quirks of ""stuck up skinny girls"" who read too many magazines, instead of the devastating and potentially life threatening illness it is.  People already don't take mental illnesses seriously, but anorexia and bulimia are a societal joke.  I've heard people make fun of their so-called friends for struggling with it.  I've watched friends be taunted and abused by their own parents for being honest and trying to get help for it.  I've read stories about underage models forced into starving themselves to keep jobs that pay almost nothing becoming hospitalized or *dying*, and seen all the comments be jokes, or self-righteous comments about the ""thin privilege"" these girls apparently held.  

If someone calls me a skinny bitch or says ""only dogs like bones"" or something like that, it....hurts my feelings, but I get over it.  It's a mean world.  We all get called mean names sometimes.  But making fun of eating disorders to tease someone about their body or make a point about thin privilege isn't just being mean and calling names and bullying.  It's insulting the person you're name-calling, and it's inadvertently tearing down everyone who's had a serious mental illness, for the sake of a joke or a childish insult.  

As an aside, I was talking to a friend of mine recently who'd struggled with eating disorders in the past, and when people who didn't know *why* she was so skinny called her ""anorexic"" as a mean joke, she thought they were making a mean joke about her being *fat,* not about her being skinny.

dolostone7," There were all sort of contributing factors, the most important one is genetic.  I hope I didn't give the impression that one toy single handedly drove me to that dark place, I just didn't think anyone wanted to sit through the whole story of how things progressed so I skipped ahead.  As I already mentioned, an essential factor is genetics.  (Only a certain percentage of youngsters have the gene for anorexia sitting dormant, waiting to be triggered)  The Barbie experience was my first trigger that set of the body dismorphia.  From that point forward, I looked in the mirror and saw myself maybe twenty pounds heavier, with a special distaste for my thighs. Every time I looked at someone else I would compare their size to mine, especially if they were smaller.    It's weird to look bad at the pictures now and see how different I actually looked like to what I thought at the time.  My mother didn't help. Sometimes she'd comment that my sister and I were much bigger than she was as a kid, or tell me I shouldn't be eating that.  That was a terrible thing to say to kid who already wouldn't go into a pool without wearing shorts to cover her thighs, and I vow I will NEVER make those sort of mistakes if I ever have children of my own.   The dam broke when my best friend in high school would say things that would especially trigger that fear of food, which is when I first acted out against the ""obese"" person I saw in the mirror and fought the enemy (food).  So yes, the whole thing wasn't because of one doll, Barbie was just my first memory of a snowball process that went out of control.   I don't like to think about that part of my life anymore, because it is filled with regret.  But I do feel responsible for sharing my story in the hopes that people understand how serious triggers can be for an unfortunate percent of us.  But my story does have a happy ending: a little while after the salad incident I brought myself to a therapist's office in tears, and got the help I needed. I now have a good control of my triggers, am incredibly body positive, and spend every day so happy that I'm still around to enjoy it.

I haven't found the 'source' yet, but I know it has a lot to do with control and self esteem issues. I don't feel like I deserve food or the space I take up. I know there are a million better ways to lose weight, but that's only a small part of it. A lot of it is about punishing myself just for being ME. Its stupid, I know.

As far as my diet, right now its mostly Brussels sprouts and Greek yogurt. Theyve become my 'safe foods'. I have an appointment with I dietician soon, and I hope to make more progress. In the mean time, I take a prenatal vitamin because ita got a pretty good variety of vitamins and minerals.

Most EDs, while not the same as a truly physical illness, are psychological ones that causes physical issues. Basically, they become symptoms.

cosmichobo,"I felt like I needed to comment, since I rarely do.

First of all, I have had almost *exactly* the same experience. Made friends on CP (this was about 2007 / 2008 tho), started chatting on MSN after that, turned out to be dickish manipulative people (they were about 14 / 15 also). Kind of weird. There were three I chatted to on MSN, a whole group of us on CP.

I'll save you the details but it lasted until about 2009, when I was 12, and I was absolutely fucking sick of them. So I cut them out, b/c they made me cry twice, and friends that make you cry are pretty shitty. I was kind of a nerdy / lonely kid (also in the same spot kinda, I developed anorexia nervosa when I was 13) by that point and I figured in a moment of wisdom that I was better off w/ zero friends rather than soul-sucking assholes on MSN.

So. No matter what they do or what shit they say (they *had shit* to say to me certainly before I blocked them, I cried a little, then played Conker's Bad Fur Day to make myself feel better), you're better off without some asshole on the other end bringing you down, esp. b/c you need to put your own health first.

The benefit of an online friend also is that you can cut them off very easily. As long as they don't have personal information (like where you live, your full name etc.) then it can be very refreshing indeed. 

It might have been better to take the turn 'mom says I can't chat to you anymore oops lol c u sometime when I get my privileges back' &gt; *never talk to them again*, but what's done is done, hey? At least in future keep that one up your sleeve, if you make more Internet friends.

I wish you all the best. xoxoxo Don't feel bad that he hates you. That's not important anymore. (Easier said than done, but you'll find that what you can do after this friendship with him is a lot greater than what you once had).",relationships,t5_2qjvn,2

It's amazing how much movement adds up though, as you said- when I was in hospital for anorexia, literally all the girls would bounce their knees, tap their feet, fidget with their cuffs all the time, and it really does add up. We had fucked up metabolisms and were put on 3000 calorie + diets, and yet only gained maybe a couple of pounds a week. This is despite being put on rest, which means no exercising.

If you take out all the normal exercise and movement you do every day, it makes a huge change if your diet is kept the same. I'm glad they taught people how to go back to normal healthily though- if you just teach people to restrict, they'll bounce around between going back to their normal, then restricting again, or just giving up and going back to being overweight.

I tried eating intuitively twice in my life. Both times I gained about 1 lb/week (but I felt so energized and happy that I kept going). I gained 30 pounds in half a year, lost it, maintained for 7 years, and then gained 60 pounds in 1 year, which I am now working to lose. 

I think my body naturally wants to be overweight.  I feel the most energized and happy when I am overweight (when maintaining a healthy weight, I am often hungry and fatigued). This makes sense because for some environments that affected human evolution, it was better to be overweight to prepare for famine. However, today there is no famine where I live. So in my case I need to fight what my body wants in order to maintain a healthy weight.  I realize this is all pseudoscience and probably wrong, but it's just my impression from how my body behaves.

soupastar,"I actually had read that before and it broke my heart. I'm 26 had anorexia since I was ten it's an on/off thing like I may do great for a year then next year im awful. I had been doing kinda well for the past three years Ilafter having a bad relapse in 2008/09 then got better then three years ago i restricted like I might eat one day then not for 3 and so on. Then got to eating daily (mostly) but this past summer I spent over a month barely eating then restricted then stopped and ate kind of normal. But December I had issues then jan hit and all I've had so far is a few bites of lasagna and a small Salisbury steak in the first week of jan. I'm falling hard and fast. I've sought help but literally there are no treatment centers or even therapist near me the closest is 8 hours. I started back in therapy with a therapist who hasn't dealt with it but none around here have! She just seems to want me to go to inpatient and was like that's all I can do and im so ducking frustrated. I called/emailed every place in two states and found two who could help one is actually in a third state but said they don't know if they could make an exception and accept my insurance and that insurance would probably fight it. The other accepts it but I have to get underweight to be accepted. I'm just so fed up. And I have done three inpatients before I was 18 the one long term one I had the same insurance and the second I was a few pounds above under they tried every damn way to get me out and eventually succeeded. And the inpatient really wasn't focused on eating at all it was more depression suicide behavioral issues and so on out of almost 80 kids I was the only one with it.

I can't get my therapist to understand how hard it is to get into inpatient and stay for as long as you need. Have you read up on chronic anorexia? It's on scienceofeds I found it really informative and im begging my therapist to just try and help me maintain right now but all she wants is inpatient and says I don't think I can help you until ur inpatient. I'm so frustrated this is why I stopped therapy the last time. And I have a kid on top of that I have nobody who could watch him if I did go away until the summer. 

I feel so stuck and beaten down. I just sat in the parking lot and cried after our session. I haven't ate a meal in 16 years that I didn't feel guilty about. 

Has your family had issues getting her the help she needs? Do you have any ideas on how I can get help. I feel so hopeless right now. Here I am back in therapy and seeing a psych for what?

lurker093287h,"What is 'objectification' (casual or not) exactly, it's such a nebulous term it seems to men 'depictions or treatment of (mostly) women that I don't like' or something. 

And that study is a bit moral panic-ish, it makes all kinds of sweeping statements that I don't think are backed up by what it links to. For example, this quite shocking statement 
&gt;Research has shown that adults – including women – who viewed sexually objectifying images of women
in the mainstream media were more likely to be accepting of violence.


cites to [this study](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/12888075_The_effects_of_gender_and_music_video_imagery_on_sexual_attitudes), which involved

&gt;students were required to attend a research session of 1 hr that was scheduled 3 months in advance. On arrival at the research site, participants were randomly assigned to one of two viewing rooms...the experimental manipulation was exposure to one of two 10-min prerecorded music video segments. The gender and sexually stereotyped video was 'the way you make me feel' (by Micheal Jackson). I chose this video because of it's striking depiction of traditional image of gender and sexuality...the second music video, 'the stand' by (by REM), was the control. This video was a 10-min music segment and excluded all stereotyped images of gender or sexuality.  After viewing the video, the participants completed a 68-item questionare...

&gt;the questionnaire...included 60 randomly ordered statements measured on a 4-point LIkert-type scale, with answers ranging from agree to disagree. These statements measured perceptions of body satisfaction, influence of close friends and unfamiliar settings on behaviour, and locus of control.

But it really gets interesting when you look at the [results](http://i.imgur.com/uLdXR9E.png); even when you leave out that 'rape myth acceptance' 'gender role stereotyping' 'acceptance of interpersonal violence' and 'adversarial sexual beliefs'  all seem subjective and were defined by the author of the study and interpreted by her,  unless I'm really misreading it, the results between the control and micheal jackson viewers aren't all that different at all, with the control men higher than micheal jackson viewing women and there doesn't seem to be any more than 2 points of divergence between control and micheal jackson. Given that it's also under lab conditions and away from 'real world' ones, I don't think that this supports the above statement, or at best it's disingenuous. 

It kind of seems similar to the research showing that playing computer games makes you more violent or aggressive, you can 'prove' stuff (even if it's short term etc) in 'lab conditions' but nothing has been shown in real world ones. Interestingly there actually has been a study that showed a real world correlation between the thinness of models in ads aimed at women (in women's magazines) and rates of anorexia, even if this might be implying cause from correlation at least it's something. 

If it is such a big influence, why do you think that the growth and ubiquity of violent/sexy video games and sexy images everywhere has coincided with (iirc) the longest fall in crime and sexual crime on record and why do you think that images of 'objectification' are so popular in places, like Japan, where violent and sexual crimes are much lower than the UK.

ElectronicWanderlust,"I had a friend like this, total ""topper"" type. You got a cold and felt miserable for a day or two? She had the flu and was bedridden for a week! Rough day at work? She had a worse one. 

Sitting at a table with Narcissist and a few other friends when the subject of food and diets came up. At this point I hadn't said much but I knew what was coming.

One friend said she was considering fasting, saying she wasn't happy with her body (she was post-preggers but not more than 15lbs over what she should have been.)

So of course Narcissist claims anorexia (no way in hell she was). Said she hadn't eaten anything that morning. Post-Preggers and Other Friend start cooing over her. I still say nothing, holding my tongue.

Food comes, we all chow down, including Narcissist. She's still regaling us with how she was soooo anorexic.

So I chime in. Hadn't touched my plate at this point. Told her I was in a therapy group for ED. She looked at me wide eyed. At this point I was in recovery (5'4"" 105lbs - was 96lb a few months prior). 

Narcissist, Post-Preggers and Other Friend, who had all been commiserating on their ""anorexia"" (yeah, the other two joined in) are now staring at me. Narc had a 2000 cal ""salad"" w/ milkshake, Post-Preggers was ""fasting"" with her Jamba Juice (no idea how many calories that had) and a plate of fries. Can't remember what Other Friend had, probably a burger, shake and fries. 

I have a bottle of water, a kids meal burger, small fries, all untouched. I tell them about how I felt literally nauseous at the sight of food and had to force myself to eat. I asked if their ""anorexia"" made them feel like literally vomiting every time they took a bite, no matter how good it tasted.

I asked them if they also obsessed with things like being able to sit down without your thighs spreading at all, not even a millimeter. 

If they ever wondered if their nostrils and earlobes were fat or their chin was too squishy because there wasn't just skin and bone. 

If eating in public ever made them feel panicky because people would notice if you didn't eat something. Or worse, you'd eat a bit but then the food would sit there in front of you, visually appealing but mentally wretched and nauseating.

When I started in on how any extra food had to be ""washed down"" by running, exercising, etc they asked me to stop. They asked if I was serious. I told them I was. Narcissist actually had the nerve to say that she could see why I as anorexic as my ass was kinda ""thick"". I think she was trying to make a joke because she was grinning at me. I didn't find it funny and left my food untouched and walked out. When I looked back at the table I saw the bitch eating my fries. Never spoke to her after that.

Best part? They bitched to our mutual friends that I was a drama queen and attention whore. Then when that backfired on them (yay for real friends!) they tried reporting me to my command. For the record, you can get kicked out of the service for anorexia. My command told them to fuck off.

There are a lot of excellent workbooks for anorexia.

I remember when my kids were little and I saw that unless I learned to deal with my difficult emotions, they would act the same way, just like I was acting like my parents. A book that really helped me was a book on journaling, [Quiet Mind, Open Heart](http://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Mind-Open-Heart-Reflection/dp/0978775767). It got me thinking outside the box, and has a lot on positive thought changes.

My sister's surgery went well. She has a plate along her femur now. Can't drive for 2 months. 

More power to you. You don't want to end up on dialysis with brittle bones. 

My sister went to two very renouned rehab centers and was in therapy for years. She was in therapy in the late 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s, but just kind of gave up after that. I think in the last 5 years we have come a long way in recognizing and dealing with eating disorders, and there is a lot more promise for therapy.

Also, funny you mention not seeing the point. That very well could mean you need a different approach. Try some books on self-help on Amazon, like the one I mentioned. Perhaps Tara Brach (I think she once had an ED, search through her books for one that resonates with you). Seek and you will find.

Brenda, anorexia is not a ""look"", it is a mental problem. You cannot look at someone and say they are ""anorexic"". 
Besides this, anorexia nervosa requires a person to be underweight in order to be diagnosed as anorexic. The person in the ""after"" photo is not underweight, not even close. The fact that you think she looks underweight is, as [other person] pointed out, a by-product of the rising obesity rate. Your perception has been skewed because people around you (yourself included) are obese.

leelem0n,"The problem is that they don't understand anorexia (or other eating disorders). They think that it's a problem you can ""catch"" through various habits, such as dieting or watching television shows with slim main characters. They don't understand that anorexia is a mental disorder that one is predisposed to having...meaning if you put two people in the same situation, they will react in different ways. The other issue is that they seem to think anorexia is a response to wanting to be thin, as opposed to having an irrational fear of weight gain and food to the point that a person puts himself or herself into a dangerous weight bracket. The anorexic person knows s/he does not look good and that's not what it's about for many. It's associated with OCD/anxiety in many sufferers and an inappropriate reaction to food and stresses. 

In other words, it's not an irrational fear of anorexia, it's a fundamental misunderstanding of eating disorders in general. 

Fatness is being normalized on top of this, meaning someone within a normal weight range is considered ""anorexic"". I never in my life thought I would hear it, but two people have referred to me as ""anorexic"" while another asked me if I have cancer.

Moomium,"People are way more paranoid about eating disorders these days, even though the dreaded media has surprisingly little to do with the development of anorexia. From memory, I think the main risk factors for anorexia are a family history, obsessive perfectionism, and anxiety. Anorexia was first described in the 1600s, so it's clearly not one of those new-fangled modern society diseases. 

I think a lot of people, particularly these days and particularly in America (the land of strong, black-and-white opinions), gravitate towards one polar opposite or the other when they start thinking about an issue. This applies to health and weight, but also politics and other societal issues (gun control, marijuana laws, etc). In my mind, it starts out with two people:

* Person A: 'anorexia is a mental illness and it's pretty bad for you.'
* Person B: 'it's too easy to put on weight these days and it's a little concerning.'
* Person A: 'but if we tell our kids to watch their weight, they might develop anorexia!'
* Person B: 'but if we don't encourage our kids to watch their weight, they'll get fat!'
* Person A: 'you're promoting eating disorders!'
* Person B: 'you're promoting obesity!'
* Person A: 'anyone who mentions weight in any context is literally trying to kill fat people!'
* Person B: 'if you see a fat person on the street you should cross the road otherwise they'll infect you with their fat!'

And that's how two people (or groups) go from a minor difference of opinion to an all-out, irreconcilable war. It's not like this behaviour is anything new in terms of human history, but I actually do blame the media for promoting only the most sensationalised stories ('woman starves herself to death after a stranger glances at her on the street') and the loudest people with the most divisive opinions ('if you don't want to fuck a fat person then fuck you').

SuperAceSteph,"One time, I practically stopped eating for two months. 

I was depressed and tired and had no motivation to do anything or exercise, I had frequent manic episodes where I stayed up the entire night and sometimes I would play video games for 10+ straight hours... I always over-ate because I didn't have any self control, and one day I decided I was tired of being fat (40lbs overweight) and that I would just stop eating if I couldn't exercise the weight off.

And so... I pretty much stopped eating. I always thought it would be hard to not eat, but feeling hungry all the time started to feel good because it meant I was getting skinnier. I usually ate between 300-500 calories a day and I chewed a lot of gum so I wouldn't feel the urge to eat. I don't think anybody really noticed too much and if they did, I wrote it off as loss of appetite, which has happened to me before.

I started reading young adult books with anorexic protagonists and reading about eating disorders. The stories were terrifying and I told myself I'd never get to the point of it being life-threatening or addicting, though I was nowhere close at the time. I had *chosen* to stop eating and I felt I could stop at any time (though not right then, because I had weight to lose), that I would go back to normal once I got to my goal weight.

After a couple months, I realized it wasn't healthy and started trying to eat normally again. It wasn't too hard, the 2 months wasn't as bad as anorexia, but it made my relationship with food kind of unhealthy for a while. Sort of an all-or-nothing thing, like if I noticed I was eating too much I would just cave and binge eat until I wanted to puke.

A few relatives have told me it looked like I'd lost weight (I did, 20lbs) but I would never, ever tell them why. Nobody knows but a couple of my friends which I mentioned it to off hand and even then I didn't go into too much detail. I haven't told the full thing to anybody, until now. ",AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,4
soupastar,"It's not that I'm not considering it I just can't do it right now, I have nobody to watch my kid. My sister can in the summer, so I have to wait. Tonight my therapist called and basically dumped me as a patient. Today was our second session and she said she wished she could help but that she really knows nothing about eating disorders and it's like she's drowning and trying to save me. She said it was unethical for her to continue because she has no idea how to help anyone with eating disorders. She also said she couldn't refer me to one because she doesn't know a single therapist around here that's handled  eating disorders. She wants to still find me a. Inpatient place though. I just feel extremely frustrated at this point, I feel like wherever I turn there's a wall. Like I'm in a room with no door but people keep saying it's there. I get her side but also at the same time it sucks Ya know? 

I've done therapy on/off since I was 10 so 16 years but I've never ever had therapy or inpatient that addresses my disorder. I was once stuck in a mental hospital for two weeks and their way of treating it was refusing to let me up from a table until I drank a shake can't remember it's name. Then as soon as I was above underweight I was sent home. I think it's really great your family has tried so hard to help her. But I can also see how frustrating it is/was when its never gotten better. Did she ever have a time where she did well? It's truly sad how little research has went into eating disorders and how to help people with them. It seems like such a taboo thing to even discuss anymore.  It's where schizophrenia was twenty years ago which is baffling considering anorexia has the highest suicide rate of any mental illness. They've discovered if you are a multiple you have a 33% more likely chance to develop it, I'm an identical twin and oddly my twin has had binge eating issues. But after our talk last night she also confessed there was times where she didn't eat for a week. They've also discovered genetics play a role as well. Here's an article you might find interesting http://www.scienceofeds.org/2012/10/14/chronicity-in-eating-disorders-how-do-we-define-it-and-what-do-we-do-about-it/

I'm glad your sister came out of it okay. Were her rehab stays at eating disorder places? I really wish my parents would of done that but for them the second I wasn't underweight I was fine.

I ordered the open heart open mind you suggested im excited to try it. For the tara one did you mean radical acceptance? I found nothing from her that was for eating disorders but I did download that book. I think at this point the chances of a full recovery for me are not there. But like the article I linked maybe to maintain it which im going to try for until inpatient. 

It's hard to see the point when it seems like no matter what doc or therapist you see it's like you're speaking Chinese to them. I'm really shocked at how many have never even taken the time to read up on or get a basic understanding of eating disorders. Especially with celebs and mags pushing super skinny. I think if I can come out of this that's what I'd like to spend the rest of my life doing, helping others who suffer. And educating those who don't on them, you would not believe the amount of females who have begged for me to teach them anorexia. It really is something a lot of people see as just a really strict diet. It confuses me how people will accept depression, bi polar, schizophrenia , and so on as mental illnesses but eating disorders are just for attention whores who could quit anytime. I don't see how someone can't look at it and realize starving yourself isn't normal, being unable to eat because it feels like it would cripple you mentally isn't normal. I really wish your sis a speedy recovery ",EatingDisorders,t5_2qpcj,2

I also think that one of the most significant issues for people with Anorexia Nervosa is that they often believe focusing obsessively on just one narrow area of their life will make everything better. It might be okay for you to want to change how you look a little bit, but you should be mindful of whether your focus on weight loss is to the detriment of other areas of your life.

I'd say the amount of people who have some condition that makes losing weight *harder* are probably close to 50% of the population. That doesn't mean they should give up, though. They just need to learn strategies that work for them.",fatlogic,t5_2wyxm,0

My dad has borderline personality disorder and is an alcoholic. After he walked in on Mom with another man and divorced her, he had a new girlfriend every few weeks and has been married to many other women after my mom. He would drag my siblings and I to his girlfriends' houses and it was very stressful to not know/control where you would be staying the night. Dad's best interest was also not in his kids and he seemed very distant from us. 

On the other side of the parental spectrum,  Mom's new boyfriend HATED me and would go out of his way to make me miserable. I was a problematic child to say the least. 

I am definitely a control freak now and obsessive control habits contributed to an eating disorder I've been dealing with for a long time. Bulimia and anorexia make relationships hard. I also feel like I really lost my parents during a crucial time in my development. Through many failed relationships, I learned that I crave being an exclusive person to my partner. My siblings and I were always put in last place and did not receive one-on-one attention. In my relationships I've had, I wanted to be the only one and the main focus.

I'm sorry for what you've gone through and are experiencing, but unfortunately the fact you still believe the root cause of your anorexia is an incident in school, and not the real underlying psychological and mental issues, a lot of which are inborn, seems to say that you haven't really learnt anything about the causes of anorexia despite being a sufferer.

plo83,"It depends on who's defining fat.  In the modeling industry, a size 4 is fat.  A size 0-1 is preferred. Full bodied models are a size 4-8 which is a normal woman at a healthy weight.  

So if we mean accepting an extreme amount of weight as OK, then no.  I'm not with it.  If we mean to finally have standards that make sense and that aren't promoting anorexia and bulimia, then yes, I'm for it.

I'm also against the idea of shaming someone for their weight.  They likely know just like you do that their weight is putting strain on organs and that they are at higher risk for (insert a TON of things).  Shaming isn't the way to make them lose weight.  You need to be motivated and food is an addiction for many.  I'm one of them.  I've been underweight, overweight, bulimic, anorexic, a work-out-aholic, a binge eater....It doesn't go away with the snap of a finger.  There usually are deep rooted issues and for me to be at a healthy weight (not under or over), I need to have sessions with a nutritionist every week.  I'm not able to do it on my own and asking for help doesn't make me weak.  I've accepted that.  Just realizing that took me a long time...But now, to add to the struggle, I have gastroparesis and Crohn's.  It's possible that I did mess up my stomach and entire digestive track with all the torture that I put it through but it's considered idiopathic for now.  I do not have diabetes (for the gastroparesis)...  So now, it's even tougher because what I have to take into account is health disorders that do affect my weight (I lost 50-60 pounds in a month and a half when first diagnosed/started getting sick.)  It's not written on my forehead that I have gastroparesis and...  So my weight fluctuates A LOT (I have a difference in size clothes of 8 sizes (30-38 jeans) in my closet.  I can wear them all in the period of a year.  When I'm wearing a 30, I'm underweight.  When I'm wearing a 38, I'm overweight.

So what is fat acceptance?!  It sounds really really simple but to me at least, it's not.  I don't want to promote a culture where I tell people that being fat and unhealthy is the norm and that it's OK so get on eating and eat the worse foods you can find...anything fried is great!  I'm not going to join the whatever they are called...National Association of Fat People and repeat the BS that they spout...that there is no conclusive research to show that fat people live unhealthier and cut their lives short, etc etc...when there are actually a TON of research that prove that it is unhealthy.  You can choose to ignore them-that's an other issues on its own...But desperate people often want to believe what they are told... ''I'm fat and dieting is hard...but these people tell me that there's no studies...''.  It's much easier to follow that than to get hit by reality and do the work.  I do think that this association should be sued (if they haven't already) because they are putting people at risk.  They are emotional enablers.  You're not a monster if you're fat.  You deserve dignity and respect.  Laughing and pointing the finger won't make someone change.  There is a human being on the inside of that body-just like inside of a thin body.  We shouldn't do acceptance but ridicule and not minding our business is another thing.  Any kid with thin parents who is fat and gets ridiculed by the parent will feel like nobody can understand them and they will eat more and more in order to try and soothe the pain.  The ridicule in this case is a big factor contributing to the obesity...  These are all things to think about when considering ''fat''.  For me at least...",AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,-2

Mahmoud_Imadinrjaket,"There are a couple of things going on here IMHO.  The first issue is a lack of education on health/fitness in general and with that comes unrealistic goals and timelines.  The second is a body image issue which is a mental thing.  I'll address each and try to keep it brief.


You say you've been working out for a month and a half; you my friend, have just barely even begun to start the transformation into a healthy lifestyle.  And lifestyle is the key word.  Working out and eating healthy isn't just something you do, it's a way of life.  It's all about consistency, and this sounds hard at first, but the beauty of it is once it becomes routine, you won't feel as bad when you miss a workout or eat something bad because it's the exception and not the rule.  Keep going and you WILL see and feel physical changes, and as an added bonus, your mental health will greatly improve as well.


Speaking of mental health.  Your feelings of self consciousness and jealousy aren't unusual.  Hell, negative body image is a huge issue in modern society.  We're constantly inundated with 'perfect' people in the media everywhere we go.  Bulimia/anorexia and depression are far too common as a result for males and females.  I'm not saying your issues are that deep, but it's coming from the same place.  Now, here's the beauty of living a healthy lifestyle.  As you become more educated and really transform your life/body, you'll start feeling much better and more confident about yourself.  Slowly, that jealousy and self consciousness will turn into respect and admiration.  Feeling like you're 'sizing' others up and having a twinge of jealousy aren't unnatural, you'll just have a better idea of what it takes to get to the level they're at and as I said will turn into more of a respect thing and hopefully a motivator for yourself. 


You're on the right track.  Keep browsing relevant subs, educate yourself on healthy foods and how to buy/prepare them frugally and continue the routine you're on.  The routine doesn't have to be perfect, all that matters is that it's consistent.  Make these a part of your life and not just something you do and I guarantee the positive physical and mental results will follow.

Back to square one.
  
Fad diets, extreme diets, and restrictions just don't work. Trust me, I've been there and tried almost all of them. You want my advice? Stop working out and eat at maintenance for a two weeks. Monitor your diet and weight. Once it's steady, add back your three weight workouts, and a **small** deficit. Monitor. Shoot for 1 to 1.5 lbs of **fat loss** per week. Right now you're trying to lose weight, but you need to lose fat instead. Slow and steady wins every single time.

The thing is that for a lot of skinny people, they are working really hard to not be stick thin, and they have to work against their metabolism to build up muscle, etc. Assuming that skinny people think that they're attractive is assuming that they automatically have no insecurities just because of their weight. When in reality, they're ALSO insecure about their weight. They don't think that they're attractive! 

I know skinny girls who are afraid to wear shorts because they're afraid of showing how bony their legs look. Men say that they like booties and thick thighs and large breasts. Not exactly the attributes of skinny people. 

Also, what if you're skinny after working really hard to live a healthy lifestyle? You finally found the motivation to lose weight and change your diet and exercise, and people tell you that you're not a real woman anymore because you decided to turn your life around and ""lose your curves."" 

I guess the point is, the emphasis of a physical quality being desirable is subjective. Just like how people with curly hair may be jealous of people with straight hair, while people with straight hair are jealous of people with curly hair. People with freckles might find fair skin desirable, while people with fair skin would die for some cute freckles. With body weight, you never know where a person's insecurities lie. You never know what parts of their metabolism they're struggling with, and you never know where they came from to get to where they are.

They first took the human bodies of executives at massive food production companies such as Monsanto and McDonald's, then they moved to acquire every other restaurant and food chain they could get their claws on. The rest, as they say, is history. My brethren and I at the Society have been trying to help, altering our methods where we could and promoting healthy eating. Our last ditch attempt was to bring back the Family Farm movement, but Monsanto lowered their prices on food so we couldn't convince people to buy untainted food. It's been really awful, I tell ya.""

""So you really think that demons are responsible for all of this?"" I ask incredulously. ""You know that humans are naturally drawn to poor choices, do you really think we needed the help of evil beings to do this to ourselves?""

""Yes, and no. You see, Cornelius, the Devil has been working on this plan for a very long time. In his efforts to take over our world, he has used all manner of weapon. He has flooded Earth; he started the Plague; he gave birth to Hitler. All of these were lacking in subtlety, and humans were able to rally together and survive. The Devil soon turned to a more sly plan, one that would put the decisions in the mind of each individual person. Through severely affecting our eating habits, the Devil sought to make us weak. He has now achieved his goal. The only thing standing in his way is you, Mr. Valentine.""

""Hold on just a second there. What do you mean, I'm the only one who can stop him? How does that even begin to make sense? I was one of the first to fall to the demonic powers, according to your story. Why do I still even matter?"" I fidget in my seat, nervous and confused.

""I'll explain when we get there. I'm taking you to the Mountain, where we are beseeching the Devil for one last audience before he takes over.""

We get to the clearing on top of the mountain where we are greeted by the rest of the nine, formerly white robe-wearing people. They hand me an odd assortment of items.

""Here you are. Put on the Robe of the Carhartt, that your body may be impervious to his claws.""

""Dude, why did you just hand me a pair of muddy boots, grass-stained overalls, a flannel, and a jacket that has definitely seen better days?""
I'm confused even more at this point.

""You must don the Armor of the Earth, that you may be one with the true Nature.""

""Okay okay, sheesh. I'll put them on.""

""And now, Cornelius, you must protect yourself with this amulet. It has a vial of the last remaining non-GMO, heirloom vegetable seeds on this Earth. It will help remind you of how food was once enjoyable. In your breast pocket, you will find a picture of you and your family and friends at your tenth birthday party. It will remind you of a time when you once loved yourself, truly and wholly.""

I interjected, ""Where did you... you know what, I'm not even going to try. What's next?""

""Very well. Next is the sweat stained ball cap of the Family Farmer. It has seen hard toil and will help you appreciate the honest labor that goes into good food. One must always wear gloves in case of thorns or in this case, claws. Now, you must eat this concoction. It is a very special combination, consisting of a nice quinoa mixed with organic kale, sesame leaves, flax seeds, arugula, heirloom tomatoes, and a drizzle comprised of a high quality extra virgin olive oil and organic lemon juice. It will help to repair and preserve your inner workings as you must resist the Devil's Pizza. Finally, we shall arm you with the Garden Hoe of Tilled Earth and the Sickle of Natural Grain. By the power of all of these combined, you shall have enough power to withstand the Devil."" The nine begin cheering.

baddspellar,"Wow. This is awful. Regardless of whether or not she will develop a clinical eating disorder, your husband is abusive, and damaging her self image when she's at an age that it's under attack by peers and the media.

First thing I'd do is talk with her pediatrician. He or she can help you plan a strategy including medical and psychological (therapy) help for your daughter, and couples or family therapy for the two of you.  This is very serious business. People die from eating disorders. Between organ failure and suicide, Anorexia Nervosa is the most lethal of all mental illnesses. I have been involved with the eating disorder community for years, between my own recovery and my daughter's, and I know people who've died both ways. I know of even more suicide attempts. Last thing this world needs again is another light put out by this terrible illness.

Next thing you have to do is talk with your husband, armed with information you get from your daughter's pediatrician.  Suggest that the two of you go to the recommended family/couples therapist. You also have to set boundaries and very clearly indicate what things are unacceptable for him to say, ever. He also needs to apologize to her and commit to never cross those boundaries again. Be with him when he apologizes, and offer your own apologies for not standing up sooner. 

If your husband were physically abusing your daughter, you would do whatever you needed to do to stop the abuse, wouldn't you? You need to be prepared to do that here too. If you have to leave him and take her with you, then that's what you have to do. Obviously, you don't want to start with this card, but you need to keep it in mind and play it if you must. 

edit: You might have assumed that I'm a mom, given that I had AN myself. I'm not. I'm a dad, and husband myself. Even my wife and I chose to do family/couples therapy ourselves, even though we both understood our daughter needed help, because this is hard.",relationships,t5_2qjvn,418

That said, I think body acceptance can be a positive.

People still seem to believe that being fat is as simple as ""I love cake and ate it till I was four hundred pounds.""

We should understand that obesity is partly culture, often partly mental illness, and that it is not fair to expect perfect behavior out of the individual when there are so many more forces at work.

shirafoo,"Hoo boy. I had pretty severe anorexia as a teenager, and my mom was a big contributor to my downward spiral because of her commenting and so on - and she was NOWHERE near this bad. Your husband has been an utter jackass, and you need to make him understand that any way you possibly can. Get it into his head that eating disorders are DEADLY and that there is NO EXCUSE for a grown person to tell a vulnerable teenage girl anything remotely resembling ""you're fat"". MUCH LESS when that person is supposed to be someone who loves her. You tell him that she is his daughter, and he needs to be kind to her, that she is especially vulnerable at this age to becoming overly critical of her body and that there is enough pressure on her to look a certain way as is. The most important thing is that your child is healthy and happy, and you need to stress how imperative it is that he agrees with this. 

That said, people are assholes and it sounds like you could end up between a rock and a hard place. If he won't change and you can't leave him without making things worse for her, that means it is up to you to pick up the slack and make up for every bad thing he says to her about her body. I have always been grateful to my brother for defending me to my mom when she made her comments and telling her off (unfortunately he didn't live at home so he couldn't always do this). I told her off too, as your daughter has done, but it's one thing to shout ""I'm not fat! Look at yourself!"" as a hurt teenager to the parent, and another entirely to hear an older member of that family stick up for you. He would say things clearly like ""Mom, I think you need to think about the way you are talking to your teenage daughter right now."" Letting her know not just that she was wrong about my body but also wrong to comment at all. This is what you need to continue doing. If he makes a comment, you refute that comment and you let her know that his opinion is NOT supported. 

Then, you need to have a serious talk with her. No holds barred, no subtle ""are you alright...?"" tell her you found her thinspo, you know how much stress is on her at her age to look a certain way, that you are very concerned for her health, that you KNOW that your husband has been saying inappropriate things and that you do NOT support him in saying those things and THEN you need to insist, as her mother, that she get therapy. She may resent you a bit, but if some adult had just fucking NOTICED what I was going through at that age and INSISTED upon doing something about it I would have struggled to get around it, but I have no doubt that if I'd gotten some therapy at that time it would have saved me A LOT of the physical harm I did my body. People disagreeing with my mom and telling me ""your not fat"" was nice an all, and quite a few of my peers noticed my weightloss and voiced some concerns (albeit not usually in a very constructive way), but not one single adult spoke to me about it, and I wish that they had. 

Read up on EDs, they are a disease and to some extent she has no control over what he head is doing to her right now, but these are things you can get pushed into, by negativity like that of your husband's, and if you are caring, firm, and attentive, you can pull her out of this before it's too late.  

I've gotten over how my mom was (and sometimes still is), but I've also moved away. I understand that she was probably taking her own insecurities out on me, but it still influenced me a lot. Your daughter probably understands this too, but it's still there in her head and it's still going to affect her. You need to help her and counteract this, and you need to encourage her to get some therapy and you need to underline the importance of good nutrition, of eating for health not for appearances, of taking care of herself and of loving her body. You mentioned that she is fit and plays sports, so you need to emphasize how great her fitness is, and make sure that she eats well and is healthy. Talk to her openly, let her know she can tell you her feelings, that you love her and that you are a trustworthy adult that she can confide in. She may not always want to though, most teens don't, and for that she needs a counselor.

Puffsdangerfield,"Anorexia and bulimia are not the only eating issues and disorders that can develop. Here is my comment on this copy pasta'd:

Setting a boundary, an expectation, and a standard for your kids is good. Enforcing them is vital as well. We learn not only from success, but from failure and disappointment. It is important to experience these things young and learn how to deal with and develop from them. Obviously not everyone is successful, but the more you are exposed in healthy ways, the better you are for it.

That being said. The use of food can have longer negative effects than positive. Just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should. Linking emotions and rewards or punishments to food can lead to unhealthy associations with food. I.E. Ice cream and cake when happy, getting good tasting food when good, etc. It can also have the opposite effect of having less desirable food, which to kids is usually veggies and home cooked meals vs. restaurant and fast food meals, be associated with punishment. In this case, that is evident. Father and son are eating a sandwich that probably has a lesser nutritional value and higher calorie content than the punishment food, which is leftovers. His punishment is to eat healthy. If he had done well, his reward would have been to eat unhealthy. I get the point Dad is trying to make, but the execution is misguided and aids in the creation of a bad habit, as well as instill the lesson dad is trying to teach at the same time.

When it comes to parenting, it is in my belief that certain things need to be neutral in children's lives so that they understand their needs and important uses of it. Food is high on that list. Being taught young that food and nutrition is an important part of life that is neither used as punishment or reward helps develop healthy habits later in life that help prevent obesity and health related issues. It's the same as chores. I don't see the point of giving an allowance for expected everyday chores. Those must be done regardless for health and sanitation reasons. Now, there are other things that are not in the scope of the normal everyday that kids can do to earn a little extra and helps instill a good work ethic. Those extra chores can also be used as a punishment as it doesn't conflict with the neutral installment of healthy living.

Regardless of that though, the point is to raise fully functional adults who are well adjusted to survive individually in society. Not just ""do as they are told"". Being able to obtain and maintain the basic necessities is a vital skill even in today's modern society. Some parents do get lost in the point of the lesson and forget that it needs to also be in line with the bigger picture. Intentions are great, but intentions mean nothing when weighed against actions. In this case, Dad just demonstrated that if you do good, then your reward is food of choosing, not food of need. As an adult, there is no one but you to balance those choices and most things are done out of habit. Habits are created through enforcement and repetition. Look at the US. We have an obesity problem. There isn't one reason why we have it. We have several factors why we have it, and a one contributing factor is how parents handle the relationship between their kids and food.

jazzoveggo,"&gt;I'm certain a bitter custody battle would hurt Ash.

No.  No no no.  NO.

Okay, it might hurt in the short run.  But your husband is an emotionally abusive bully and your daughter is vulnerable.

Let me give you some perspective.  I grew up like your daughter: not fat by any definition of the word, but also not a ""waif"", either.  Fortunately, unlike your daughter, I grew up with parents who weren't assholes.  (Edit:  I'm referring specifically to your husband, not to you, btw.)

But my parents also weren't perfect.  (No one's are.)  Specifically, they are the kind of people to comment on people's bodies, not to their faces, of course, but they're always quick to comment if someone has gained weight or ""needs to lose weight"".  I now realize that their perceptions of what ""skinny"" and ""healthy"" are are unrealistic and skewed.  For example, my dad once made a comment about how Sandra Bullock (of all people) ""could stand to lose maybe ten or fifteen pounds.""  My parents have also, throughout my life, emphasized to me that I'm not skinny, but I'm average/normal.  And okay, fair enough, I am average/""normal"" in weight.  But paired with their obvious preference for skinniness, negative remarks if I appeared to gain weight, and reminiscing about how they used to be so skinny and could eat baked potatoes loaded with butter every night for a midnight snack and never gain any weight when they were young, it's enough to mess with a kid's head.  And then I got anorexia.  I was actually able to stop myself before things got too out of hand, but they still don't know it ever happened.  At the time, they praised me for my weight loss.

I absolutely do not blame my parents for what happened.  Overall, they were very good parents and I have a good relationship with both of them.  What I'm saying is that even non-abusive words and behavior patterns by parents can have a negative impact on vulnerable or at-risk children.  Meanwhile, your husband IS abusive and your daughter pretty clearly is being affected by it.  And divorcing and getting her away from him if he doesn't stop is essential.  It might hurt in the short run, but in the long run it might make the difference between having a daughter with lifelong body image issues and a dead daughter.  And while not ideal either way, the former is vastly preferable to the latter.  If the abuse gets interrupted quickly enough, your daughter might even have a chance at being 100% cured.  Please keep divorce a real option.  This is a life and death matter.

^ This person is correct. I developed bulimia at age 20 (late, I know), followed by anorexia a few months later. When I did eat, I would puke it up. I lost 60 lbs over the summer, and fought these demons for 2 years. My mother tricked me into counselling after I came home from uni and she thought I was close to death... I had lost half of my hair so maybe I was? 

I've now ""recovered"" (aka i'm fat), and even though it was 5 years ago, my relationship with food/drink/exercise will never be the same as it was before. I never feel ""normal"". I'm constantly walking on the edge between safety and insanity. It also affected my mother. Now that I've been out of the house for a while, every time she sees me she's convinced I've lost weight (even though I haven't) and I know she worries that I will slip back into my head.

Do not let her go down this rabbit hole OP. She has NO idea what is waiting for her, and once she gets sucked in your daughter may never be the same again. Your husband has NO IDEA how fucked up he is making his daughter's life and health. He is a grown ass man and should know better.

snallygaster,"Pure fat acceptance isn't the answer, but outright shame/bullying isn't either. If it were only a matter of fat being unhealthy, shame might be the answer, just as it has curtailed smoking addiction and drunk driving, but fat is also considered ugly, so calling somebody a 'fat fuck', 'piggy', etc. is essentially calling them ugly as well. Which, of course, can lead to insecurity and mental health issues, since being called ugly is a very crippling insult to many people.  This can cause problems in the form of anorexia, bulimia, or even more binge eating, since food is a great comfort/diversion. Of course, fat acceptance is also pretty awful given that the movement enables unhealthy eating habits and gives fodder for people to rationalize away their fatness. I think that encouragement and reward for healthy habits and (healthy) weight loss are the best way to tackle the problem, along with widespread education about how to eat healthily and the consequences of obesity (and the positive consequences of fitness!).

Though, you shouldn't be taking a nutrition class without being prepared to have to get over this hurdle. There's a difference between someone being insensitive by forcing someone to do something that could bring about psychological problems, and a student with those problems specifically taking a class related to said problems, then complaining and playing the 'omgz u triggrd meh!' card when (surprise surprise!) a nutrition course has you track your own habits.",fatlogic,t5_2wyxm,4

 I wore a heart monitor and had to drink this nasty electrolyte stuff for weeks. When I get home I will edit this with some more info. 

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refeeding_syndrome

Any individual who has had negligible nutrient intake for more than 5 consecutive days is at risk of refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome usually occurs within four days of starting to feed. Patients can develop fluid and electrolyte disorders, especially hypophosphatemia, along with neurologic, pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, and hematologic complications.

During prolonged fasting the body aims to conserve muscle and protein breakdown by switching to ketone bodies derived from fatty acids as the main energy source. The liver decreases its rate of gluconeogenesis thus conserving muscle and protein. Many intracellular minerals become severely depleted during this period, although serum levels remain normal. Importantly, insulin secretion is suppressed in this fasted state and glucagon secretion is increased.[4]


During refeeding, insulin secretion resumes in response to increased blood sugar; resulting in increased glycogen, fat and protein synthesis. This process requires phosphates, magnesium and potassium which are already depleted and the stores rapidly become used up. Formation of phosphorylated carbohydrate compounds in the liver and skeletal muscle depletes intracellular ATP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in red blood cells, leading to cellular dysfunction and inadequate oxygen delivery to the body's organs. Refeeding increases the basal metabolic rate. Intracellular movement of electrolytes occurs along with a fall in the serum electrolytes, including phosphate, potassium and magnesium. Glucose, and levels of the B vitamin thiamine may also fall. **Cardiac arrhythmias are the most common cause of death from refeeding syndrome, with other significant risks including confusion, coma and convulsions and cardiac failure.**

**This syndrome can occur at the beginning of treatment for anorexia nervosa when patients have an increase in calorie intake and can be lethal.[5] The shifting of electrolytes and fluid balance increases cardiac workload and heart rate. This can lead to acute heart failure. Oxygen consumption is also increased which strains the respiratory system and can make weaning from ventilation more difficult.**

Now from an outside perspective, we could say you're probably safe, since they're there for the money, but if you were actually there, with your head down, while armed men make demands, well...you'd probably be pretty scared, and could reasonably believe that your life is in danger.

jerseyproud,"Calorie counting didn't cause your disordered thinking, though - it sounds like your disordered thinking is what caused you to count calories. You were already afraid of getting fat, so you started counting calories. 

Counting may have given you the outlet for your disorder, but it's likely that you would have found another way to do that without it. That's what the illness does to you. I agree that calorie counting is dangerous for individuals who are already fighting disordered thinking, and they should absolutely avoid it, but the problem is the disease, not the way it manifests.

My behavior wasn't fueled by a distorted perception of my body; it was fueled by my all-or-nothing attitude. I was able to see, without distortion, that what I was doing could potentially be harmful, and stop. Someone with a disease like anorexia cannot do that.

beatlefloydzeppelin,"Anorexia is just a symptom caused by something else. It sounds like you have some anxiety issues, and maybe some depression from time to time. Both of these can definitely cause anorexia. But it could also be something less obvious like zinc deficiency or Crohn's disease. And (I don't mean to scare you because it is unlikely) it can also be a sign of something more serious like cancer.

But it is impossible to make any progress unless you find the root cause. May I ask why do dislike our ""current diagnostic system?"" I understand that some people are cautious with drugs and medication (as they should be) but a diagnosis is just the process of finding the cause of a persons symptoms. You don't have to take any medicine that they prescribe, do any of the tests they recommenced, and in fact you can completely ignore their advice if you want to. But getting an opinion of someone who has spent their entire life studying humans and medicine can never hurt, especially when the recovery process might only involve some simple lifestyle changes and some therapy (talking is about as natural as it gets). So once again, I would recommend seeing a doctor, even if you don't follow their advice.

I was also a straight-A student but became depressed when I hit adolescence. Both of these things are common: depression is more likely to affect the intelligent and symptoms usually occur during puberty. 

The cutting and anorexia stuff is all about low self-esteem, and I think your daughter needs to seek treatment for depression. To clarify, that treatment doesn't have to be medication; but it definitely needs to be therapy. 

The secrecy and sexual exploration are all fairly normal for a teenage girl. Obviously, you want to improve her mental health and provide her with all the support you can, but freaking out and waking her in the middle of the night isn't going to help her self-esteem. 

With proper treatment, your daughter will be just fine. She's going through a lot of hormonal changes and it's normal for her to do some things to explore her independence. Overreacting will make her trust you less, so you need to find a balance. ",relationships,t5_2qjvn,6

tierillo,"I think it's very important to focus on preventing obesity in childhood. If a kid grows up fat, chances are they will be fat their whole life, and that's a burden on all of us. 

I think it could be addressed in schools, but with the way school funding is set up, I don't think that they will be able to accomplish much. I'm one of those people who thinks that schools should be funded federally and equally, so we wouldn't have so many discrepancies in school quality based on which neighborhood you live in.

Someone linked an article here or on / fatlogic about the school lunch program in Japan. They have a great approach that would be affordable over here, but it will never happen because of the way our current lunch program is set up.

In Japan, elementary school kids take turns carrying food from the kitchen to the classroom and serving it to their classmates. The food is cooked fresh each day, and each school has a nutritionist on staff who plans balanced meals with seasonal and local ingredients. A lot of time is spent to make sure that all the kids learn the importance of proper nutrition and portion sizes.

In higher grades, there are mandatory cooking classes that teach students how to prepare actual meals and how to analyze fat/carb/protein content and calorie count. Home ec classes in the U.S. pretty much just teach the food pyramid and the students only learn simple recipes that usually aren't healthy, like biscuits, cookies, and pasta.

If our whole culture continues with the attitude that calorie counting is either pointless or a sign of anorexia, snacking all day is normal and good, skipping a meal is dangerous, eating vegetables is for pussies, and going to the gym is the only way to lose weight, the government has no chance at improving the standards for what parents and schools feed their children.

They tried introducing calorie limits, but with current school meal plans that just means they are serving smaller portions of shitty food. You could have a huge portion of nutritious food for the same calorie count if you include more vegetables and unprocessed ingredients. That's something that kids need to be taught.

* her mother had it (is this **genetic?!**)

* she had the RAI, *and after hers, and others, RAI stories I have to admit I'm glad I didn't.* I got halfway through, and they pulled me as being ""not a candidate"" **halfway through**. Seriously. It's a multi-day process, and I went through half, and insurance called and said my bloodwork proved I responded ""atypically well"" to MMI so they STOPPED. But again, not so sorry now. —Yes having a sudden upticks SUCKS, I know, but it doesn't sound like RAI works for everybody ***at all***

* She's done her RAI, isn't great about her meds *maybe* (she admits), and has some fierce enough hypO symptoms that she graduates a year early, and also because along with depression and weight GAIN, her eyes started TEDding. Her endo said ""don't worry."" **Yep: that's my experience with endos.** *Again, glad I'm working this out on my own, none of their experimental ""treatments"".*

* Wham: full-blown TED. Couldn't close her eyes to SLEEP, and it happened fast (**also my experience: I went from 20/20 vision to bifocals and dark glasses in a matter of 2 weeks.** One of those weeks, they had to change my prescription before the dark glasses even got in. Endos can just be so *special.*

* Orbital eye socket surgery helped her, but not all the way.

* I believe she's 18 and out of h.s. now. She's looking for communication there; I don't YT because of privacy issues (Google owning it), but she has an email. I'd love to invite her here.

* To this day, she's hypO and (it sounds like) hypER.

I've avoided hypO because when I was titrating up on my MMI last year (2013 now, I guess: I dropped weight 7-8 years ago, but wasn't diagnosed until late 2013. Was tested for drugs (I did none; not even alcohol); was tested for anorexia; and was generally treated like a snake in the grass until some lab *finally* had the balls to contact my doctor and point out all the exclamation points in my CBCs since at least 2009, since I'd been put through every other test known to mankind. I didn't know what TSH was, but GP should have. —I could still throw that doctor through a window.)

Once though, I overtook the MMI (moved up to 15 mg from 10mg) and the next day was like a living blanket of Hell. I'd never had depression before; I never want it again. **That sucked.**

Right now, my regimen is 1.5mg of MMI *divided* (one eighth of a pill, twice a day); flax seed oil for TED (which has dramatically improved with MMI); tons of Xanax (since doc presumed it was ""anxiety"" for years, though I'm ...**chilled TF out); and propanolol (to which I'm slightly hives-allergic.

Yes, if you're part of a family full of huge people and you see what it's like to be them, then it definitely contributes to not wanting to be like them.

I've actually recently discovered this sub and love it, I think it's hilarious and so true the way people try to justify their obesity. I'm also not your typical ham, growing up I was always the fat kid, my whole family was fat, the only vegetable I saw until I was 14 was iceberg lettuce on a burger.
Not trying to blame my family, but by the time I was 14 I was obese 5'6 215lbs. I was your typical ""it's in my genes!"" kinda fat kid who would skip gym class. 

My mum and dad split up, and all of a sudden my mum decided to drop all sorts of weight, and started pressuring me as well. ""shame, I bet you'd be pretty if you weren't so fat"" ""You know no one would ever even hire you for a job, being so fat makes you seem lazy"". I'm not disputing what she said isn't true, but there was no sugar coating for my fat self to eat!
So I took my mum's advice and started losing weight, and she was so proud of me! Dropped down to 160lbs in less than a year, but I just couldn't shake the rest. I worked out, calorie cycled, but I just couldn't break this plateau. I decided extreme calorie restriction was the way to go. A few months later I was down to 126lbs at 5'8"" and eating 400 cals/day. My mum was still so proud, wasn't until I fainted on the stairmaster I got rushed to emergency and when I told the doctor what I would eat per day. So I got sent to some teenage anorexic camp bullshit, where we were force fed 1600 cals a day and told to love ourselves. Gained 30lbs the first month, a pound a fucking day!

Fast forward to 22, I'm a chef now, so yes I eat a lot of shitty food, and I know I'm fat. I try to stay in shape (round), I jog 5kms daily, try and eat greens. End of the day, I'm still munching on duck confit, cakes, creamy sauces, etc.. all day at work. I know I eat roughly 2500 cals a day.

&gt;-Guys go MTF because they actually are faggots and think they will be able to land a dude easier as a woman. 

&gt;-Girls go FTM because they are fucking hideous and ugly, and rather than compete in the beauty/attractiveness arms race with other women, just say fuck it and become a dude. Notice how you NEVER see good looking women become FTM transmen, its only ugly ugly ugly bitches. That is why I think the whole ""trapped in the body of the opposite gender"" mindset is a bunch of bullshit because if it were true we'd see more 9s and 10s become female to male transmen.

just like we've been saying all along! this is pure gold. although, i'm personally willing to concede that a fair number are plain mentally ill. the best analogy i've seen is anorexia. no way would you give an anorexic liposuction, so why would they perform sex reassignment surgery on a tranny? but, yes, i think the majority are exactly as you described.

Rackenisawesome,"I can't technically classify you as anything - I'm not a doctor and I don't have enough information of your diet/life style - but I will say restrictive EDs refer to purposely eating an extremely low amount of calories (and possibly other things, but the main one is calories) to lose weight over a long period of time. Basically, it's anorexia, but with people who don't meet the weight/body fat % or the psychological requirements to be diagnosed with it. I guess it's possible to have an ED where you stay away from other foods like catbs, but like all EDs there's a certain psychological element, usually a great fear of messing up the diet or losing weight, more than a ""rational"" person would have. There's a difference between restrictive EDs and restrictive diets. Things like keto and paleo diets restrict things your body doesn't really need, so they're not really ED level. A calorie restriction diet would be something like cutting from 2000 to 1600 to lose weight, or even down to 1200. Restrict EDs are cutting your calories down to under 1000, an unhealthy amount.
Is it possible restrictive dieting, even healthy ones, can cause the obsessiveness that turns into EDs? Oh yeah, definitely. That's probably how most EDs start. People with high anxiety or addictive personalities should always be careful, the most important thing is vein healthy. ",fatlogic,t5_2wyxm,0

Feel free to take what I say with a grain of salt, though. To add on to what the previous posters said: Think about it like this: that sort of behavior may not be categorized as an eating disorder until it becomes something you can't necessarily stop. Eating disorders like anorexia create this illusion of control that really doesn't exist, and unlike a diet, it can't just be dropped the next day without afterthought. E.g. they may feel guilty or anxious if they can't count calories, carbs, fat, etc. or restrict to a certain amount or type of food, where someone without an eating disorder may go back to eating like normal as though nothing happened.

Don't read ahead if you're going to criticize me for being a melodramatic teenage girl, please. 

I am slightly over weight, in my opinion, but I am conscious that I am not obese. I am 159 cm tall, and weigh 123.5 lbs. I think about how I look every day. The worse thing is that I live as an expat in Thailand. Here, in this country (and excuse me for the generalization) the population is small-- I mean, small small, skinny small, as in, an ""M"" here is a size ""XS"" in the US. And social media doesn't help, the girls in my school have pictures of them in bikinis with their flat/toned stomachs and I haven't ever worn a two-piece in public. It's so disappointing. I got into sports after being bullied for being fat, and even after that I havent been able to lose weight. I guess it's because I don't see food as fuel but as an enjoyable part of the day, I don't know. I remember telling myself one day that I wish I had anorexia, because they at least are on the better side of the spectrum (yes, I know that what I said to myself is controversial and wrong, but I am saying the truth, as this is tagged as 'SERIOUS'). 

Just today my friends asked me to go swimming, because it's really hot and they've just finished with the SAT tests, but I have to stay home and reddit because while the girls will be having fun without thinking of their bodies, i would be covering up my protruding stomach because sometimes I forget to suck it in. 

Also, I can't wear everything I want. I need to pick and chose. Not only because some tight things show off my stomach, but because the general female population native to Thailand do not have large breasts and I, from South American origin, do, and flowy-frilly clothing makes it look as if I am even more fat than I am.

It makes me feel so unwanted, so unattractive, so disgusting. I mean, I know I'm not the ugliest at least, but unless it makes me feel so self-conscious.  I wish I had the drive to follow through with a change of a diet. It's pathetic.

I honestly really felt sorry for him at first. 

I have struggled on and off with mildly underweight up to to almost-dead 12.2 BMI, hospitalized many times from complications of anorexia nervosa for many many years. I finally got help, and am very healthy now but I absolutely remember how clearly and deeply any comment about my food affected my then-messed-up-mind and a single comment would make me do incredibly stupid stuff like throw away all my food in my apartment or only drink chicken broth for a week or four. 


What I want to mention is that I now volunteer time at group therapy sessions and there are many men - the number of males who are affected by them is highly increasing. Not just gym addicts. Starvation restrictive anorexia is getting very common in men and increasing. It used to be thought of as a young rich girl issue but now just about anyone can get it. I don't mean dysmorphia or gym obsession, I mean purposeful restrictive starvation by men.

littlebigelephant,"Re: weight, I am recovering from anorexia. I masked it by restricting my eating out of concern for type 2 diabetes (which runs in my family.) I still have unhealthy thoughts but I don't act on them anymore. My self-esteem with regards to my body sucks but my eating problems are more of control issues stemming from rape and abuse and I relieve them with less harmful methods of control now. I'm 5'3 and at my heaviest was 130 lbs, in the middle of puberty. Lightest as an afult was 105 lbs, and I think my ""natural"" weight (sedentary and neither overeating nor undereating) is 120 lbs. I have never told my parents about any of my eating issues. I am generally a light eater but i love food and I'm not picky so they've never been worried about it.

My parents call me ""goondu papa"" (fat baby) as a term of endearment and it makes me feel like crying whenever i hear it but they will not stop since they think i am being oversensitive. I probably police their diets more than they do mine, since they are both diabetic and love potatoes...so I gotta make them eat other vegetables occasionally. They're ok with it though. 

My mom is slightly overweight but has a disproportionately large belly and has cried in fitting rooms because of how it limits her fashion choices. I am very insecure about mine too, but I think it's independent of her issues. However,she does draw attention to my nose, tweaking it and calling it my ""big beak"" and this is something else I do not like at all but I can't exactly tell her about it. It's the same as my dad's family nose so I feel like if I say anything it's indirectly insulting his family lol. Actually I have zillions of body image things i'm insecure about but the worst are my weight, body shape, and face in general.


Most of the skin color remarks have been made by people outside my family. They are hurtful sometimes but i can ignore them. I certainly wouldn't mind if my skin was lighter but only so it'd be easier to buy matching makeup.

katek8kate,"Just want to clarify that my eating disorder was never energy-restricted. In ""restriction"" mode, I only ate certain foods at certain times, had to have ""perfect"" macros, and refused to eat anything I did not prepare myself because I didn't trust calorie information from restaurants. I was controlling, but I never restricted to an unhealthy amount of calories. Then when I ""broke down,"" I would binge and purge constantly for days. This developed toward the end of weight loss, and I actually maintained my weight while it was going on because it's near impossible to actually lose weight when you're eating and puking 20k calories a day every day. You just can't get it all up.

So yeah, just to clarify the timeline. Had problems with binge eating as a coping mechanism for OCD &gt; went to treatment, got on meds, and lost 80 pounds through normal eat less, move more strategy &gt; meds began losing effectiveness and OCD became fixated on food and weight loss &gt; redeveloped problems with binge eating as a coping mechanism and added compensatory purging, maintained 80 pound weight loss through period of disordered eating &gt; went to treatment, got on different meds and lost remaining 10ish pounds over the course of a year with balanced diet.

So when these people talk about how they had a restrictive eating disorder, I can believe that they restricted sometimes. But they deny the fact that they were reactively overeating later, resulting in weight maintenance or even gain. You cannot be anorexic and be fat, but they all want to claim that they had anorexia. The reason they do this is because if they couldn't be skinny when they had anorexia, then obviously weight loss is literally impossible, and it would be unreasonable for anyone to expect them to lose weight.

Winsling,"I've been thinking about the parallels between personal finance and weight management lately.  In both cases, it's easy to let your intake and expenditure get out of balance - and when you do it's a lot of work to fix it.  Virtue, taken too far, turns into a vice.  You can't out-excercise a bad diet, just like you can't out-earn bad spending habits.

Through this metaphor, you sound like you're financially anorexic. Translated into food; you're on a strict diet, to the point it's affecting your life.  That's not enough for you - you'll deviate from that diet to deny yourself even more.  You watch the numbers on the scale go down, but with no clear goal in mind.  You just know it's never enough.  It's not a perfect parallel.  You're much less likely to die from this than from real anorexia.

It's similar to the body image issues that people can develop in conjunction with anorexia or bulemia.  Apologies to continue to disagree with you, but BDD has been used to invalidate trans identities.  It's a fairly well known mental illness that serves as ammo for the argument that trans identity is a mental illness.

Also, BDD doesn't affect your body as a whole usually.  Sufferers of BDD are usually drawn to individual traits of their body and see them as flawed to the point that they'll have to spend significant amounts of time hiding or concealing them.  BDD doesn't get better when people modify their bodies, because it usually finds the modification similarly flawed or the flaw just moves to another point on their body.

nellirn,"I am currently getting my doctorate studying recreational vs. medical marijuana. The US government has declared it as a Schedule I drug and the FDA has approved two medications, Marinol (dronabinol) and Cesmaet. They are used for nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and for anorexia in AIDS patients. 

Several clinical trials are under way, most notably for Epidolex, which is a oil form of cannabinoids used to treat Dravet Syndrome, an infant epilepsy disorder that is very difficult to treat with conventional epilepsy medications. Another clinical trial is for Sativex, which is an oral spray used to treat the relief of spasticity in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. It is already approved in 19 countries. 

The US government has let the individual states decide if they want to legalize medical or recreational marijuana. As more and more states allow the substance, it is simply a matter of time until it is widely accepted in all 50 states. Change like this usually takes about 20 years. It will take time for more and more researchers to conduct high level randomized, double-blind, controlled studies that are peer reviewed and published in respectable academic journals for it to be more acceptable to prescribers. 

Medical students are now being taught a completely different view of marijuana than those who attended 20 years ago. It is going to take a generation or two for it to be widely accepted and for the government to change the classification of marijuana.

I hand in my test as well. I can't get the last question and there's no use listening to this whining. I have chem work to do.

I head to my dorm room without interruption. Gonna be a long study session. I keep getting side-tracked, though. I really want to start my psych project to get it rolling. I've been given 10 credits to travel twice on the university's dime and any further travel is up to me. 

I'm still not sure where I want to go, though. Should I visit Freud or Lacan or Piaget? Should I visit a time in history where the people are still mostly a mystery psychologically?

But then I have it. I'm going to visit myself as a child. I remember being very happy and carefree. I want to see what I was like to be around and analyse myself.

There's no danger in this since I can't influence the past. Safety barriers have been built for preventing it. 

I put on the safety gear (you can be thrown around a lot in the process) and set my Time stick coordinates. Immediately upon pressing 'Start' I'm thrown into a maze of light. I feel very nauseated and then it's over. 

I sent myself to encounter myself on the way home casually. I can't see- oh! There I am. I'm 8 and walking from school.

I approach myself and clear my throat ""Hey Anne, I'm friends with your mom. Can we talk?""

""Yeah, sure."" Younger me says, kicking at a rock.

""Are you happy?"" I ask, wasting no time.

""I guess."" She says, still kicking at the rock.

""What do you mean?"" I ask.

Young Anne looks up at me with tears in her eyes, ""Roger keeps calling me fat. I think 
I'm fat, too, so it hurts."" She says, pulling down her sweater and picking up the rock. She throws it at the road angrily.

""Oh. Um... But you're not fat."" I say honestly.

""Yes I am!"" She says emphatically. ""I need to go on a diet.""

It really started this early, eh, I think to myself.

""What if I told you you're a healthy weight for your age?"" I say.

""I'd say bullshit. My bmi says I'm overweight. We just did them in class."" She says, picking up another rock.

""Please don't throw things."" I say, grabbing her arm.

""You're not my mom!"" She yells, running away.

I grab my Time Stick and head back to my own time. Looks like my memories aren't so accurate afterall. I started my anorexic spiral when I was just 8. I thought it was later.

I decide to head to after my anorexia hospitalisation at 13. I think grade 9 was fun after that but I don't remember for some reason.

I plug in the time and coordinates and go through the light maze to me at 14 at a party. I am just young-looking enough at 21 to pass for an 18-year-old.

I spot myself alone and walk up to her.

""Hey. Cool party."" I say, leaning against the wall with her.

""Yeah."" She says, turning her head to look at me. ""Do I know you? You look familiar, like I met you yesterday or something."" 

""No. I'm a 12th grader. There's no way I-"" I start, but get interrupted by the Time Stick. It is doing something funny.

""I swear I know you."" She says.

All of a sudden, the Time Stick starts to flash and I'm pushed away from my younger self. This is the Time Stick's way of preventing me from changing the past. I have no choice but to stay 10 metres away.

I see a boy approach my younger self. She talks and laughs with him for a while and is handed an open beer. She drinks it almost greedily, despite the calories. She wants to impress this guy.

In 30 minutes she is passed out. That's all it takes. He must have spiked her drink. The guy says he's gonna put the lightweight to bed but upon entering the bedroom, he closes the door. I try to reach the doorknob in vain and then try to talk to anyone who can go open the door for me. I am invisible to them.

All I can do is stand there while I confirm that, yes, I was violated at this party. I was sore the night after and remembered nothing and no one said a thing about this. Now I know people saw.

I go out the door and behind the bushes to make the Time Stick take me to present day. I fall sobbing on the ground in the present. The past hasn't changed but I've changed. ",WritingPrompts,t5_2s3nb,2

Hallelujah_Brother,"Just in case anyone is curious as to what /u/not-actual-account wrote: 

*I know that when people browse this subreddit they tend not to think of the people they're talking about. You're not interested in the fact that you're expressing hatred for living, thinking human beings with their own thoughts and feelings. And that's entirely understandable. When you're on Reddit you're nothing but a username, and when you type something into it you are in no way accountable or identifiable. It makes sense that people will pour their heart out over their pet peeve when they know they'll receive no repercussions for doing so. And this isn't the thing I have an issue with, as it is in fact what I am doing right now. The problem I have is with the theme of this subreddit.*

*Now, don't get me wrong. I am not a ""healthy at every size"" type. I know that being overweight has very negative effects for your health. I'm aware of every nasty problem that being so will do to you. But I hope to share my experience about how you don't have to be overweight to be unhealthy, especially mentally.*

*For the past six years I have tried to overcome anorexia and self-loathing. For most of my life I was overweight for as long as I could remember. By the time I was 15, I was 5'10 and 236 lbs. I was easily the fattest student in my entire school. I never exercised and spent most of my free time eating crap. My parents weren't interested. By the time I was 11 I desperately wanted to do something about my weight. I begged and pleaded with my mum and dad to help me to get into exercising but they didn't care. My dad runs his own business and my mum was indifferent to everything except perhaps watching TV. My mum did the family shopping and no matter how much I asked she always brought in junk food. I would go to my room to cry because my dad would get frustrated if he knew I was upset, and when I came to him and told him that he wasn't supporting me he became infuriated because he thought it was an insult to his person. So I took to just eating in an attempt to ""take my mind off"" all the issues I was having at the time, and after that I ballooned.*

*Primary and secondary schools were living nightmares. I was not only bullied for my weight, but for my race and my social awkwardness. I don't think there was a single person I can think of that I can look back on and call a true friend. When I entered Year 10 I thought that I could drastically turn myself around, lose my weight and gain friends in the last two years before I left school.*

*Knowing nothing about proper weight loss, I decided that the most efficient way to lose weight was to refuse to consume food so that my body would feed off the calories my body was carrying. I would eat my breakfast and dinner and that would be it. I stopped eating school meals, and I refused to enter the kitchen so I wouldn't pass the food cupboard. After two and a half weeks I weighed myself to find that I had only lost one pound. I was angry and confused, and made the ""realization"" that I was still eating far too much. I think you can figure out the next part.*

*It took being hospitalized to realize how severely I had starved myself. Over the course of slightly under a year I had inflicted serious damage to my body due to my low-self esteem, and had, during fluctuating periods, contemplated suicide. By the time I got out of hospital it was just in time for me to take my GCSEs, and I had not revised because at times my health was so poor that I didn't have the energy to do anything. I did far worse than I my target grades said I was capable of because of it, and I went to a different college than the one I had been planning to.*

*Anorexia can be unbearably painful. My arms and legs would seemingly heave due to how much they ached when I tried to run. My teeth to this day are rotten due to how many times I made myself throw my lunch up. My fingers have begun to show symptoms of arthritis.*

*Although I'm much better now, I'll never truly overcome some of the psychical and emotional damage I brought upon myself. If I had just one person to emotionally support me when I begun I could have actually lost weight in a healthy way and have become confident in myself. What did I receive instead? Insults, name-calling. There was no-one to help me with my struggle with my body, but more people than I can count who were willing to demean me for their own entertainment.*

*I have no difficulty believing that the people who post on this subreddit are the same who would have been more than happy to have joined in with the bullying. Years of torment brew nothing but me nearly killing myself through my own self-pity. Maybe if, instead of pointing and laughing people like yourselves had decided to reach out a friendly hand I wouldn't have to spend the rest of my life with the aftermath of the damage I inflicted on my body. Considering how highly you would have all thought of me, why should I try to be any better?*

bluecanoe22,"This is my personal theory on why so many obese FA'ers claim to have ""restrictive"" diets and anorexia. Their weight is primarily caused by overeating - the loss of control over what they eat and how much they eat. Anorexia and ""restrictive"" eating are both associated with extreme control. They are able to restrain themselves (to a dangerous level) in regards to food. If these obese people have supposedly been anorexic, it means they've tried to control their portions, their calories, etc in the past and it ""didn't work."" If restricting their diet (supposedly) in the past did not work, then how could anyone tell them to try it again in the future? Thus, their bodies must ""just want to be"" a certain weight, it absolves them of all responsibility, and they can stuff their face as much as they want.

thelittlestpanda,"I guess the thing with diagnoses is that they have to meet a set of criteria, and if you don't fit the bill, you don't get put in that category. 

One of the dumbest examples is that until recently, to be diagnosed for anorexia nervosa you had to be a certain weight and have missed 3 periods. So no matter how sick you were and how long you'd been starving, you weren't anorexic until you reached that threshold. 

I'm not sure what the criteria for Bipolar I are now, but last I read you had to have at least one full-on manic episode to be classed as Bipolar I. So maybe that's why she's reluctant to give a diagnosis. What did she think about Bipolar II? I think you only need one hypomanic episode (and depression) to meet the criteria for that. 

My psychiatrist here in the UK said I met the criteria for Bipolar II, but the European system only recognises Bipolar I, so ""officially"" I'm not bipolar either. (But if I were in the US I would be!)

If you don't mind me asking, why do you feel like you have Bipolar I and not Bipolar II? I always thought the main difference between them was mania.

dream_in_rainbows,"When I was eighteen my family and I were traveling home from a wedding and made a stop in Kansas. The rest stop had a rock as a decoration and I decided to jump off of the rock. I ended up breaking both of my feet and my left ankle. Completely destroyed them. I had surgery on both feet and the left ankle to fix the major breaks, and then a year later another surgery, and the year after that a third surgery. Total over all that I spent 23 weeks in a wheelchair. Wheelchairs, walkers, and canes were the only ways I could get around. I was told I would never walk without pain again, I would never run, or be anywhere near as active as I was.    It absolutely destroyed me, I began doing nothing but sitting around and eating. I got up to to 225 pounds, when I was able to walk without any aids, I was still miserable and in pain.    One day I decided enough of that and decided to lose weight. It began as a diet, but then food anxiety and restriction took over. I got down to 121 pounds, and was diagnosed with anorexia last year, I can run again, and my ankle or feet no longer hurt, unfortunately now my hands go numb, they're are a shade of purple from lack of circulation, I've lost bone density, I've had three heart attack scares, a surgery to remove my gallbladder and I'm severely malnourished. I have terrible mood swings and awful concentration issues. I regret jumping of that rock more than anything in my life.

2a. resistens har inget med kärnan av GMO att göra. Sen kan man om man vill utveckla växter med resistans mot herbicider och insekticider men det har ju återigen endast att göra med användningen av GMO och inte GMO som teknik. Visst ogräs och insekter blir till slut resistenta i många fall men då är vi på frågan hur man ska hindra skadedjur och växter på bästa sätt och inte på GMO.

2b. En artikel som hänvisar till greenpeace...? :/ Inte helt köpt. Sen är argumenten inte särskilt bra. Det låter nästan som att man borde ha förbjudit solpanelers utveckling och användning bara för att de är dyrare än andra energimedel. Sen är återigen ingen av kritiken riktad mot GMO utan mot att företag sätter höga priser på det. Det är en helt annan fråga och enligt mig irrelevant. GMO kan utvecklas i fred och sen kan vi diskutera huruvida företag ska få sälja det vid ett annat tillfälle men det hör inte till frågan om GMO ska tillåtas eller ej och om det behöver diskrimineras endast för att det innehåller modern teknik. 

3. ""varför ska vi lägga ut mer investering i forskning som gör det möjligt för storföretag att lägga patent på groddor och konkurrera ut fattigare bönder? nej tack, inte för mig."" Patentfrågan är irrelevant i diskussionen. Den har jag ingen åsikt om och ska inte ha påverkan om GMO-produkter bör diskrimineras eller ej. Företag som konkurerar ut fattigare bönder? Återigen irrelevant. Jag är inte insatt i frågan om hur det påverkar samhället men du får gärna ge någon info på varför det skulle ge en nettoförlust.

4 Ekonomin beror ÄR väl vad ett land producerar? Har ett land ingen produktion så kan de heller inte försörja sig själva. Det spelar ingen roll hur mycket pengar vi pumpar in. GMO är ett sätt bland många att öka en bland många produktioner. Om fattiga länder med låg produktion slipper importera dyr mat och istället producera billigare mat (GMO eller ej. spelar ingen roll för de ska dömas på sina egna meriter) ser jag inte problemet. 

Hm antar att jag kan ha missuppfattat saken men vi i väst har väl inte endast en stor mängd pengar? Anledningen till att vi har kombinationen ""mycket pengar och högt värde på den"" är väl för att vi har sådan hög produktion av varor och tjänster? Hade sverige varit urholkat på fabriker och universitet vet jag inte om våra pengar hade varit värde så mycket. (Detta är min egen tolkning av ekonomi så rätta mig gärna)

""genom att man slutar blåsa de på deras egna råvaror"" För att detta ska ske måste bönderna där vara konkurrenskraftiga vilket kan underlätta om de har tillgång till billigare sätt att odla på. 

""I sådana länder pågår det helt andra förhållanden som skapar obalans i deras styre och landsstruktur som förhindrar de från att bli självförsörjande och det handlar verkligen inte om GMO."" Nej fattiga länders orsak till fattigdom kan man inte spåra till en sak. Men dålig infrastruktur, utbildning och produktion är ett par av de viktigare. GMO kan hjälpa med en av dem. GMO kommer INTE att lösa problemet själv men om det kan ge en nettoeffekt som är positiv för landets ekonomi och folkhälsa ser jag inget problem

Firstly,  let me stress that I'm grateful for your response, and I'm not trying to change anyone. What I have works for me, for now. It may not, for anyone else. This is totally cool. And thanks for not reacting reflexively and negatively and just downvoting and moving on. I care zero about Reddit karma, but I do love a good, open-minded dialogue!

Secondly, I have no need for justification. I'm happy with how things are,  although I'd be happier being more open too. That just may be laziness, it's certainly not guilt: I don't think what I'm doing is wrong. :-)

Third, my wife is welcome to do what she wants with her body, and with whomever she wants, in order to attain happiness and fulfilment. I have explicitly told her that I place no exclusivity requirement on her. I'd be 100% undisturbed if she had a boyfriend or girlfriend, pr some of each,  as long as it made her happy. I do care about her. This is like saying I wouldn't ever restrict her from eating what she enjoys - for one thing it's not my place to control another adult, for another, why would I want to stop someone I care about being happy, anyway? If she got too involved with food and it was getting unhealthy, I would ask if she was sure she was eating right, and point out any health effects, but it's her life and it is unthinkable to me that I should control it. I'd do that for anyone I care about.

I get that sex is emotional sometimes, but I just think that's the same as saying it's an oxytocin rush. It's like saying really good food is delicious and provides a set of amazing sensations, but that's because of the chemical interactions of the food with my taste receptors, plus some psychological elements like ambience and company. To say this is not to demean emotion and make sex mechanical, but we are all chemical machines, really. I like dopamine experiences and vasopressin experiences and oxytocin experiences because I'm human,  so I'm wired that way. Sex gives me some of this, but so does food, music, exercise, beauty... None of these are ""special"" and not for sharing. 

Your point about masturbation got me thinking, but social sex is different to solo sex, and better - although they are both ultimately material phenomena, so based in neuro-physiology. I'm not averse to rubbing one out when I'm horny and nobody is available or willing to play with me, but I don't have that need much these days.

I do experience some degree of emotional response to sex, whether with my wife or my friends, it's just not special to a sufficient degree to make me monogamous - which is an unnatural state for humans anyway. Joy from sex is not a zero-sum game, more is better. I think we have been subject to social control systems for sex (a.k.a. religions) for so long that we have confused them with being absolute truth. Sure, sex can have unwanted consequences (babies, STIs, dodgy hookups, violence...) but so can food (obesity, poor nutrition, major health problems, anorexia, comfort eating...) - it's all part of being a mature human to figure out how to control these needs so that we avoid the consequences. Marital demands of exclusivity are the equivalent of saying you'll get really upset if a friend eats chocolate cake (or carrots) and not be their friend anymore (and take half their stuff) - they're only allowed to eat cauliflower and cabbage because that's what you want them to do. It's crazy (to me, but might make sense to you, of course). 

EDIT: Spelling (!), plus added some lame food analogies.

EDIT2: You make another point I'd like to pick up on.

&gt; There is trust, passion, love, romance, etc...in a moment of sex that increases the enjoyment and willingness to work with a person--to get along and to be happy.

Roughly speaking: trust=oxytocin, passion=dopamine, love=very good question, but it's also a collection of chemicals not magic, romance=behavior required to get sex and entrench reward, mostly. Sex is used for bonding, no question. This is a big part of how bonobos do sex, too, and they are close relatives. They are absolutely not monogamous, though, so prove you can bond with multiple others quite easily.",sex,t5_2qh3p,1

Second, I was told I was being 'ungrateful' for the body I had.  I love my friends, but most of them are overweight.  I'm not, so wanting to lose a few pounds was met with outright hostility.

If you are obese and carrying 60 lbs of fat, then your body can generate up to ~1800 Cal/day. For most, you would just need to hit your protein targets. You would be able to lose a theoretical maximum of ~3.6 lbs of body fat per week.

However if you are near Bikini weight, and you only have 15 lbs of body fat, you can only burn about ~450 Cal/day. And lose a theoretical maximum of .9 lbs/week of fat. 

In Scenario B, you would have only have 1250 available calories (which would also shrink each week). The deficit between that and your caloric need would cannibalize your muscle and heart tissue, killing you the way anorexia does (albeit slowly) and causing permanent cardiac damage.

The person they see in the mirror isn't them, and they can't see themselves for how they truly look. They are extremely self critical and often don't seek help until someone forces it upon them. You can lose weight and overcome an addiction to food with a plan, some motivation and a willingness to better yourself.

Someone with anorexia is going to live with that for the rest of their lives and unless they stay proactive with recovery and are aware of what their triggers are they can and will relapse. You can lose weight, you can break addiction but there's no sure fire cure for mental illness. 

This is coming from a former fatty who is dating someone who is recovering from anorexia. I've seen both sides, and I would recommend gaining some awareness to the illness before you make a comparison.

POOR_IMPULSE_CONTR0L,"It's amazing how in the second and third paragraphs you were literally being the kind of person you talked about in the first paragraph.

Genetics are completely black and white. You are either quite explicitly male or explicitly female. A few people are both, but virtually no trans people are both. While it can be and is argued by many that being trans isnt a mental disorder, and the fact that you can totally lead a normal life as a trans person would tend to support that, the same cannot be said for hemaphrodism, as that has a lot of really awful stuff, like physical problems, associated with it. I would put it in a category of disorders along with things like dwarfism.

But treating trans people as if they dont have a disorder is stupid. The motive for doing this is to help them feel better, but thats stupid. Most living human beings have at least one disorder of some sort. We all have fucked up mutations and genetic predispositions that are not ideal. It's an unfortunate side effect of evolution. But it is definitely wrong to look at something that causes a significant amount of psychological trauma to a person as not being a disorder. If trans people didnt have a disorder then they would be happy as they are, rather than hating a part of themselves. Would you say that someone who has body dysmorphia doesnt have a disorder? Anorexia? Exactly.

And while human evolution is definitely the evolution of societys and groups, and thus there is absolutely *room* for gay people and trans people, that doesn't change the fact that the primary purpose of *sex* is reproduction. Sure, pleasure is also a factor, but thats more of a secondary benefit that was accidentally produced in the pursuit of a psychological and physiological incentive to have sex and thus reproduce.",funny,t5_2qh33,0

Two things that would help bring out your feautures: define your brows. Look on /r/makeupaddiction for products and advice. Just a little definition can make a big difference. You don't have to wear a ton of makeup, or any if you don't want to, but a touch of mascara, brow definer, and blush can perk your face up a lot. I think your hair would look amazing in a layered cut with a bit of volume, maybe loose curls or waves. This would frame your face nicely and tone down the ""chubbiness"" you're concerned about.  
If you're concerned about your weight, get into a regular exercise program-something that is both enjoyable and limits you from over-doing it since you have a history of anorexia. I find that personally, doing a combination of intense yoga and body resistance exercises works well for me. Maintaining your exercise regimen is also going to help your mental health and self esteem. Adopt a healthy diet with an emphasis on protein and nutrient dense veggies/fruits. Make sure you get enough healthy fat. I find that by eating this way, I have been able to personally develop a healthier relationship with food and avoid reverting back to starving or binge/purging.

snallygaster,"The similarity between anorexia and binge eating disorder (or ED-NOS related to overeating) stems from control; anorexics gain a sense of control in their lives through limiting their food intake to extreme degrees, whereas those with clinically-diagnosed overeating type disorders gain a sense of control in their lives through eating as they please.

tzivje,"It is something that never 100% goes away, I think. I was overweight as a pre-teen, and spent a lot of time feeling terrible about myself. I went anorexic at 14 and lost over 50 lbs. Food and weight issues continued to be a struggle, even though actual anorexia only lasted one year or so. I eventually put about 30 - 40 lbs back on.

I started running when I was 19. That helped me feel better about my body, and helped me keep myself in check and not worry *quite* as much about food.

But what really kicked it all in the butt for me? Pregnancy. At 26 I got pregnant. I knew I had to quit any restrictive eating habits in order to have a healthy baby. So I ate what I felt like eating during pregnancy, and while breastfeeding for 18 months. I did continue my running and exercise while pregnant, but didn't get down on myself about getting bigger. I knew I had to. I quit counting calories at that point, which was totally liberating. 

Now I am 30, and in the best shape of my life. I run 4-5 days per week, and I let myself eat as much healthy food as I want, and usually one small treat per day.

This is a good moral viewpoint, I suppose, until you add in the fact you a) have a mental illness and b) sometimes forget how important you are yourself.

And yeah, it's precarious for me talking about it now (coming up for 5 yrs after diagnosis!), because on one hand there's always a possibility of something triggering my anorexia, they're ignorant about some aspects simply for the fact they've never experienced it first hand, and also because...I've learnt, in the long run, keeping my issues to myself and psychologist is much easier. I hit the jackpot with her. She knows me deeply after these years. I love seeing her.

you just need to to talk to her , and dont let her try and change the subject because that might happen, be very gentle about how you say anything because its a very personal subject , maybe help her find a doctor online/counselor in her area, i somewhat know what your going through you just need to keep talking about it more and more with her so she feels alot more comfortable to open up about it more,

Acolyte_of_Swole,"Hahaha! ""Fat people work harder on their health than thin people.""

Let's parse this out a bit.

First off, when she says ""thin,"" she either means underweight/skinny/true anorexia or else she means normal non-fat people. I'm going to assume the latter because MOST non-obese people are not anorexic.

So she thinks fat people work harder on their health than the normal-weight people. Hahahaha, not even close.

Every normal-weight person who was born normal weight has had to regulate their portions and the types of food they eat in order to not gain weight. Otherwise, *they would have gained weight.* Some strenuous activity can allow one to eat a lot more food, but I'd wager a lot of non-hams aren't super atheletes. Their daily activity isn't nearly enough to allow them to eat like planets without consequence.

Now add to this every normal-weight person who used to be obese. All of *them* have to watch what they eat and be healthy. But if anything, they have to be even more careful than the normal non-obese because they've already flirted with food addiction, emotional eating and binging. So these are the people who used to be ""fat people who worked harder on their health than thin people"" according to the image, but now they're slim and fit. Hmmm, it's almost like they had to work *even harder* to lose the weight and remain healthy than their fat selves, who were supposedly so super healthy! Strange...

Finally, we have underweight people who try to gain weight. These people, if they want to gain healthy weight, have to do a fuckton of work on their health. Anyone can binge at Taco Beetus, but these people have to figure out what to eat to both meet their nutritional needs and put them at a caloric surplus. 

Now, back to the fats. What do they do that is such ""hard work"" for their health? They eat pretty much whatever they want in whatever amounts. Oh sure, they might yo-yo diet now and again, but c'mon. I come from a family of hams and I know what happens behind closed doors. Hams rarely, if ever, exercise, and if they do their exercise is pathetic compared to what a normal person can do. There's a reason fat people aren't sprinting in the Olympics.

I guess, like another commenter said, fat people spend a lot of time at the doctor's office dealing with all their chronic condishuns, so I suppose that's ""work"" to them. Although it's not really that much work if you are using taxpayer money to cover your expenses (depends on the country where you live.)

To her claim that losing weight is unhealthy, this is not even slightly true. Loss of weight can lead to the alleviation or elimination of a number of obesity-caused diseases and condishuns. Weight loss and proper diet can even reverse Type 2 Diabeetus or pre-Diabeetus. It can render PCOS asymptomatic. That she equates weight loss with yo-yo dieting shows that she (and by extension, many fat people) really don't spend much time on health, or else she would understand that sustainable weight loss is possible and even easy with a permanent life change.",fatlogic,t5_2wyxm,2

Funky_Groove,"To answer your question directly, no, but they should be since business costs and consumer demand are not as detached from economic reality as some would like to believe they are.  It doesn't matter how low one shaves their business costs if there's no market to buy one's products and services.  With regard to your second point, comparable costs are lower in developing countries because they don't have the same infrastructure maintenance costs as developed nations.  Remember, they are just beginning to develop their infrastructure.  

Let's not forget that it is suppliers who set the standard of living in every market since it is created by the prices they charge for their products and services.  In order to bring down wage levels in the U.S. without triggering an economic collapse, suppliers would have to lower the prices they charge for their products and services too.  Yet, they have only raised them, increasing and accelerating the probability of a market collapse.  Let's also not forget that the rest of the world is striving to attain the U.S. standard of living, not the other way around.  Only a fool would strive to create third world economic conditions in any market (i.e., highly concentrated national income/wealth, virtually no middle class and a large, impoverished lower class) since it amounts to economic anorexia.

**Main Goals for R16**  
* Become consistent with my workout schedule. I have a great plan, but I am the queen of excuses. No more!  
* Become consistent with my meal plan. I still have trouble swinging wildly from eating too little, to eating too much. I'm aware of it and I just need to be more conscious of my habits. I have a great meal plan also; I just need to stick with it!  
* Lose weight the **right way**. I'm slightly overweight, and it needs to change. Basically if I stick with the first two bullets, this one will take care of itself.  
* Spend more time actively involved with my daughter. It amazes me how easy it is to let an evening pass by in front of the TV without even noticing it. I know I spend a lot of time with her, but I think we need more time with NO other distractions. Just small things, really.  
* Start making small progresses with my house. There are a lot of things my boyfriend and I would like to do, but we do a lot of talking and not a whole lot of DOING.  
  
That's about it! Really, all of my goals could be summarized by less talking and more doing.

This is the third time I have been sectioned and I would prefer not to say my weight but I will say it has gotten to the point where it is life threatening and has affected my vital organs some of which will never function again normally.

I am unwell. I have not starved myself into almost nothing because I want to ""look sexy"" as no matter what weight I am, I will always want to be less. Numbers on a scale matter to me, it isn't about being toned (since muscle weighs more anyway) it's about those numbers on that scale and on the tape measure when I measure my hips and thighs being as low as possible - and they have never been low enough. 

Anorexia is true insanity - I am a nurse, intellectually I *know* what damage I am doing to myself but the anorexic in me simply doesn't care.

Anorexia is often a symptom of other troubles - it is a coping mechanism and a way to exercise control. It is a distraction and something I can retreat into when I am stressed or upset. I often wonder if I make it out the other side just what I will do with all this free time I will have when I'm not constantly obsessing about calories, how I am going to avoid eating and planning out the lies I tell my husband about my intake. It is a constant battle in my head *all the time.*

Most recovered anorexics will never become ""chubby."" My treatment is not about ""body acceptance"" at all, right now it is about survival and about fixing the things about me that give me this desperate and uncontrollable need to starve and play Russian roulette with my life.

slenderandabitlonely,"Do you have an eating disorder by any chance? I struggled with anorexia when I was in my teens. I also didn't understand how to eat properly for a while.

Now, I use cronometer to track my calories and macros. You should calculate your BMR (basal metabolic rate) and the add your Daily calorie expenditure (how much you burn exercising) to that. That's how many calories you need to eat to maintain your weight. If you need to gain weight, add food accordingly.



My BMR is about 1100, and I burn another 500/600 doing daily activities. So, I can eat roughly 1600 calories per day. This varies depending on how much I exercise. Cronometer is great because you just insert the amount of everything you're doing and it keeps track. I also set up my macros (carbs/protein/fat) to a certain ratio. This isn't absolutely necessary though.


If you aren't gaining weight and need to, you could try eat a couple of tablespoons of nut butter for a snack. Nut butters won't make you feel really full but they keep you from being hungry and are calories dense. Sometimes, if I accidentally lose some weight, I'll just eat a tablespoon of cashew butter with flax seeds every day along with another snack like a sweet potato with a little bit of butter.

lovechip,"Or people with eating disorders. Binge eating disorder is very real. Anorexia is one end of the scale and binge eat disorder is the other. To overcome that often requires significant therapy, changes to the environment and who people are around.

Some people are overweight to hide from abuse they may have suffered. This is a very common reaction to being sexually abused.

Some people may have experienced traumatic events or bullying and have found food as the only way to control their fear, sadness, anxiety.

I used to be a personal trainer and in the first sessions with a client, I would get them to go through a guided relaxation, very briefly, then when they were in a relaxed state, consider what their fat was. What it represented. Everyone who had a significant amount of weight to lose found this quite intense. They didn't have to tell me what they thought, but they all actually did. The answers were stress, fear, sadness, loneliness, anger - my clients had to deal with everything to memories of child abuse, violent bullying, violent partners or simpler things like moving out of home, finding yourself alone, far away and with not enough energy, resources, etc to do a great job of looking after themselves. 

To gain a significant amount of weight you also don't have to be eating in a totally out of control way. For many, this thing creeps on very slowly over the years until one day, they weigh twice what they were. 

I have never seen a client who lacked compassion for themselves keep their weight off. Keeping weight off is an insanely difficult thing to do anyway. By hating your former self, that anger is sort of a motivation to stay slim. Motivation sucks and has a habit of totally disappearing. The longer you've been slim, the more you might forget about the anger and motivation to stay slim so you fall back on old habits that have been suppressed rather than properly dealt with. 

Then you have people who are super fit, eating a diet that's not pleasurable, with muscles bulging out all over the place. This, I believe is an eating disorder too or exercise disorder. The people I studied with on the personal training course were mostly amped up, perfectionists with this weird atmosphere around them like crazy dance music was always playing. Some were balanced, the ones with this personality type were just not. So, just because someone looks like they've got the perfect body and perfect health, this could be a red flag that they're actually struggling just as much as someone with anorexia or binge eating disorder or bulimia.

He always told me how she wasn't responsible for what she did because ""she just doesn't like children"". and that bit him in the ass, because I ended up blaming him entirely.

## My diet
 I've straddled the lines of anorexia and binge eating disorder at various points of my life. I'm trying hard to stay mindful without getting obsessive.  I can indulge occasionally, but not all the time! I like to find healthy recipes and healthier options for the foods I like so I don't feel deprived. Eat less processed/junk food.

**CALORIE COUNTING** (I'm stressing this pretty heavily) My calorie limit is currently 1200-1400 a day because I exercise a lot. When i had more fat to burn I was doing 800-1100 a day. [MFP](http://www.myfitnesspal.com) is an amazing resource between calorie counting, exercise logging, and the accountability and motivation of friends going through the same journey as you. I also use [this IF calculator](http://www.1percentedge.com/ifcalc/) pretty heavily for determining my BMR, TDEE, macros, etc.

**Intermittent Fasting:** I do a 10 hour eating period, though there are many intermittent fasting plans (5:2, Leangains, 6 and 8 hour windows, the warrior diet, etc.). IF is one of the only diets I have seen a lot of scientific evidence for in human and mice studies: improves blood sugar control, hunger control, reduces inflammation, encourages fat oxidation, protects against asthma, diabetes, hypertension, obesity. I personally love it because late night snacking was one of my biggest vices. After 8pm I get to turn off my food brain, I don't dance around in the kitchen trying to get myself not to eat anymore. 

##My exercise:

1. C25K - Awesome way to get into running for anyone of any fitness level! Currently on W5D2. I use a free app by Syncostyle that tells me when to run and walk.
2. Zumba - I play a couple Zumba video games. I love dancing, and because its in my house I have no excuse not to do it. Its one of the only exercise regimes that I've been able to stick to long term.
3. Yoga/Tai Chi - Relaxing workouts great for the health of mind and body.

daaaaanadolores,"Yup. Diagnosed currently with anorexia nervosa type II, major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder, ADHD, dyscalcula, and PTSD. I was formerly diagnosed with bulimia nervosa (it turned into anorexia), and was misdiagnosed as bipolar.

Something has always been wrong. In regards to the ADHD, I was a bright kid, but I was always distracted and disorganized, and couldn't ever follow through with anything. I just thought I was stupid and lazy. I was *finally* diagnosed at 15 and prescribed Adderall, and suddenly life made so much more sense. Turns out, I'm not an idiot; I just have ADHD.

I've been depressed and anxious for nearly the entirety of my life. I know it's partly due to genetics--my dad was a crack/heroin addict diagnosed with bipolar I, ADHD, general anxiety disorder, my mother has had bouts of situational depression and anxiety (and probably narcissistic personality disorder)--but I've always just felt wrong. I didn't understand how social interactions were supposed to work; everything felt so forced and fake. It always frustrated me, because I'm such an inherently logic-based thinker, and emotions (in my mind) were irrational, and thus shouldn't affect me. It doesn't really work that way, unfortunately.

I don't think I can only blame my genetic predisposition towards mental illness, however. I was physically abused by my paternal grandmother as a child (she used to water board me if I cried when she was bathing me...even if I was crying because there was shampoo in my eyes), my father OD'd when I was 13 and I was subsequently disowned by my paternal grandparents (who supported themselves by selling drugs, I might add, and supplied my father with drugs from the age of 4), my mother had a midlife crisis that was more like a nervous breakdown, and I just have so much emotional, verbal, and physical abuse in my past, that it would honestly be *impossible* for me to *not* be mentally ill. I try and deal with my emotional baggage through logic, which works about as well as using a hammer to trim your lawn: it's the wrong tool.

My parents didn't like dealing with my feelings themselves, so I've been in therapy since I was 9. I started taking Prozac when I was 14, but stopped after 6 months, and didn't start taking antidepressants again until I was 18. I think they've done me some good, but it's hard to tell. I struggle greatly with dissociation and depersonalization and I suppress memories when I'm deeply depressed, so it's hard to objectively compare how I feel now and how I felt then. Plus, when you're malnourished, antidepressants are not as effective as they would be otherwise, which is a problem when you have an eating disorder.

Now, I'm 20, and very medicated, with the following regimen: Effexor 225 mg, Adderall 20 mg 2x daily, Xanax 1 mg daily, Latuda 40 mg,  My friends call me a walking pharmacy. 

Currently, I go to one-on-one therapy twice a week, group therapy once a week, and see my psychiatrist biweekly. I've also checked myself into the psych ward in the past, have done DBT, and have been enrolled in an eating disorder outpatient program. Therapy helps. DBT was great. Group therapy is hard for me, because it's difficult for me to relate to other people my own age when I come from such a different background than them. I'm still working on it.

Depression, Anorexia, Rape -  all problems are presented as outside of the victim. 

3 is my favorite of the male posters. Noting the composition, I see it more as showing Invulnerability exiting the boy's Vulnerable body.  That works as both a visual narrative and a juxtaposition.  It's fantastic.

The first two images show a strong jawline, well formed lips, and lines on the cheeks indicating high-strong cheek-bones. Some tension is communicated in their body language, but otherwise the body language is strong and disregards the accusatory language.  Only the boy succumbing to pressure in # 3 has a less masculine pose and his form is diminished by his hunched stance.  His smaller frame, baggier casual clothing, and the comic-book poster give a sense of youth.

Two of the women are scantily clad with exposed shoulders and cleavage - but their body language suggests submission to the accuser.

""Responsibility deprived tumors grown around a penis.""  Is that a popular social view of men, or Babis' view of men who don't become fathers?

Holistically, this communicates a lack of comfort with weak men on Babis' part.  She desexualizes, maybe even dehumanizes, them based on how much they succumb to the pressure in a way that she doesn't for the women.  As a woman it's natural for her to place the pain of men as distant (Men are human too), while holding the pain of women as personal (Remember.)  

Her artwork is beautiful.  Her message is beautiful.  Her desire to help feels very genuine.

Add this to your list to talk to your doctor.  I am on it myself.

**wellbutrin**

* Anti depressant that works differently than other antidepressants.  Often used in conjunction with serotonin anti depressants for the more stubborn depression that needs an extra kick.  Also used to counter serotonin side effects such as sexual side effects.

* ADHD med.  Off label in the US for stimulants are more effective generally.  Some studies show effectiveness similar to methyphendiate instant release but Concerta (methyphendiate - oros) in the same study is shown to be more effective due to superior drug delivery.

* Anti smoking drug, as well used as a craving reducer for other types of compulsions tied to dopamine such as over eating.  You do not give this med to a person with anorexia or bulimina for the med will reduce the craving to eat.  Helps restore the distinction between hunger and appetite.

* It is a drug that makes you more alert and awake.  Used specifically for seasonal affective disorder where you become tired and depressed during the winter.  Sometimes it causes insomnia for it is harder to feel tired.

* Just a general mood elevator.

Wellbutrin is a cheap drug to get due to many generic makers.  It may not be enough to treat your ADHD for it does not block as many of the reuptake pumps on a percent basis as a stimulant does.  That said it is a great combo drug for many of the commorbidities with ADHD for it treats those and unlike the stimulants it stays in your system all the time and this provides many advantages.  For example even though the med helps the pleasure center it does it so slowly your body does not realize it and thus no euphoria.  Thus you do not get addicted to this med like the stimulants and it is used to help people quit addictions such as smoking.",ADHD,t5_2qnwb,2

Your daughter has some things to deal with and its great that she'll seek help with that. There are things in her life that bring her to manipulating her feelings by means of food. Having dealt with bulemia and anorexia for the greater part of my life there's one thing i can confidently say: in dealing with eating disorders IMHO it should best be avoided focusing on eating itself and food but accept that the disorder is merely a tool, a method of self regulating emotions. My personal opinion is that behavioral therapy is the place to focus on, the input / output of food might be better focused on if serious health issues exist and if not accompany BT. Nevertheless: I just want to point out the maybe very, very minimal chance that your husband also has an issue with dealing with his emotions and is just unable to cope with it on his own and his method of coping isn't food but sticking to a allegedly ""perfect"" image of his family and especially his daughter..

Regarding fat: companies love sprinkling your food with MSG, for example. You know, that lovely stuff which makes you think hamburgers and other crappy foods are actually tasty. Bonus, poor people often have no clue what the healthy alternatives are, so they get trapped in a vicious cycle they have no clue how to break.

The (fast) food industry is a race to the bottom - whoever can use less costly ingredients and still pass the concoction as ""edible food"" wins. Food satiating you but giving very little nutrients, etc etc.

Regarding anorexia: ... scratch this conversation. If you think mental issues can be solved by ""powering through them"" (or whatever you mean by ""personal choice""), then we have no common ground. Would you also suggest that people who suffer panic attacks are just pussies whose personal choice is to keep getting them? Claustrophobiacs?

Anorexics have deep-seated self-image issues (oh yeah, and some fat people have them too). Sometimes you can't work through your issues without outside help - in the best case that means friends and family talking to you, but it can often mean you need a professional.

As someone who has struggled with an eating disorder for over 10 years now (currently EDNOS/OSFED, previously purging type anorexia), I wish my mother had fought so hard for me when I was a teenager.

So, keep in mind I don't know much about your daughter, except the little you've put in this post. However, I wanted to speak to you about what might happen with your daughter in the future. Obviously, it could be that she was just flirting with the idea of pro-ana and it was just a zealous diet that can be cleared up in a matter of a couple months with a therapist and nutritionist. But, I was once a teenage girl searching the web for pro-ana too, and here I am, so I'm going to speak as though she actually did acquire an eating disorder. If not, feel free to ignore.

Know that the road ahead is going to be bumpy as hell. Eating disorders are bitches and they love the shadows. She might have a hard time coming back from where she's been and her relationship with food may take a really long time to be ok. Definitely get some counseling yourself. It's very hard to be the rock for someone.

Advice (unless her therapist says otherwise): 

* Don't make comments about her looks, either positive or negative for a while. Even being told you're beautiful can be a trigger for an eating disordered person. Compliment things she does, her personality, things you would like her to focus on controlling rather than her weight. 
* Don't get into battles of control over her food. Most likely, you'll lose. We can be very...almost rebellious, I guess. And the disorder drives you to lie to meet its demands. If you and the disorder come head to head, most likely it will win. 
* If one day you feel the need to force her into a recovery center, know that those are not quick fixes. Like a drug addict being forced into rehab, most relapse unless they want to recover. Generally, the best you can hope for there is a weight recovery.

At around 10 yes old my dad started saying I ate too much and I was built like a man (if you look in my submitted picture history [NSFW!!!] you will see I'm actually very much built like a woman and very tiny). By age 11, I began cutting myself whenever he called me a man, and by age 13, I was full-blown anorexic. And if I was forced to eat anything, I would throw it up. This lasted until I was 22 and 5'6 and 89 lbs. and I was so skinny. My dad never realized he was the problem. A few of my friends knew and finally my boyfriend at the time said you are getting help whether I have to baker act you or not (for cutting, I don't think he could baker act me for the anorexia). So I started trying to eat again to get to 110 lbs. and started seeing a therapist about my cutting and it was hard and I cried when I looked at myself as I was gaining the weight back, because I saw myself as a huge obese man, even though of course I didn't look like that at all. I am now 24 and still struggle with the urge to cut and not to start skipping meals when I feel I look a bit hefty (5'6 and 117 lbs now, still underweight but decent). What your husband said can have long term effects on her even if you try your best to tell her she's beautiful. Not saying she may be cutting (that's a rare thing to do and I'm not even sure what prompted me to start) but she will always live with what he said. Your positive words don't always make up for his mean ones. All I can say is keep her in therapy as long as she feels she needs it and don't let her get to the point I did. I could have died at my lowest weight and that didn't matter to me, all that mattered was that I didn't look like I built like a man.

ButtsexEurope,"Slightly chubby was seen as more beautiful because it was a sign of wealth. It meant you could afford lots of food. But Reubens liked 'em hefty. 

Later, as food became plentiful and famine a rarity, skinny was beautiful because it meant you didn't pig out. Anorexia was also seen as a sign of faith because there was some saint who survived for years without eating out of piety. The hourglass shape became ideal with the introduction of whalebone corsets. Tightlacing meant any woman could have an hourglass shape. This means that any feminist who says that skinny women being beautiful is a ""recent thing"" would have to define ""recent"" as the Victorian era. By that logic, the idea of childhood is a recent thing as well. 

Now, the size of breasts and butts varied based on fashion trends. In the turn of the century, big butts were in. There were even bustles (things that made your butt look bigger by poofing out your skirt) combines with corsets and flat chests were in. In roman times, women bound their breasts to get the youthful flat look. In the 1920s, a flapper look was more rectangular, no hourglass shape. But in the Middle Ages, a big high bust with lots of cleavage was a sign of youth and virginity. There's even a difference today from the mid century and even 90s that big butts with a small waist are sexy now.

&gt;
&gt;I’ve had a talk with Ash. The things we discussed were personal to us and irrelevant to you. She’s going to visit a therapist that I have found who is excellent. I know that she has a long road ahead of her and I’m disappointed in myself for allowing it to get this far. 
&gt;
&gt;As for my husband…I told you that I would be trying to get him to visit a therapist, and that is true. I decided to be prepared before I would have this discussion with him. I had an email conversation with an attorney on Saturday. Attorneys don’t give free legal advice of course, but I’d paid a consultation fee and he talked to me for quite a bit just over email. I don’t want to discuss that conversation here because it is very technical but all of it was very helpful. 
&gt;
&gt;Ash had a long practice yesterday that coincided with when David would be home, so we had a private conversation. When I told him about the notebook and showed it to him (with Ash’s permission), he brushed it off and said that a notebook full of diet tips and thin women “shouldn’t be unusual” for a young girl. I told him about some statistics I looked up and about how anorexia can kill a person, but he said those are exaggerations and Ash clearly is just on a diet and needs to lose some weight.
&gt;
&gt;The big blowup came when I mentioned that I thought he was insecure about his weight and that was what was making him criticize Ash. He started yelling, saying that he is not overweight, he works out three times a week (not true), and that he doesn’t really have diabetes and the doctor who diagnosed him just wants to make money. I thought that all was a distraction so I brought it back to Ash and I said that if he feels bad about himself, he could talk to a therapist or me about it, but that it is selfish and repugnant to involve Ash. He scoffed at the idea of the therapist and made several insulting comments on how therapists aren’t “real doctors”. 
&gt;
&gt;He started going in on my weight, telling me that I am not a good role model for Ash and that she needs to be a healthy weight and look good, ignoring the issues. I saw that he was being bullheaded and I realized that he didn’t care enough about my daughter to see his own behavior clearly. I told him that I would be getting a separation until he enters therapy, apologizes to Ash, and acknowledges his own issues. If he wouldn’t do that, we would be getting a divorce. This was something that I had discussed with the divorce lawyer, who had dealt with situations like this before.
&gt;
&gt;He basically told me that I would not be able to survive without his money and that he would take everything in a divorce. He was trying to intimidate me and use my lack of knowledge of legal matters. However, I knew this would not be true. I told him me and Ash would live in a cardboard box without him and be happy, rather than in a mansion with him and miserable, just to make a point. He brought up some of my own personal issues and some of our other marriage problems, but I knew it was over. I told him to get out of the house. He didn’t want to leave, but I threatened to call the police. The house is in my name so he didn’t have a legal leg to stand on. I suppose he is in a hotel right now. 
&gt;
&gt;I have hired the divorce attorney and I will be filing for separation and having David served. I will wait to see his response. I cannot believe how quickly this happened and how quickly it soured. But I knew, in my heart, that something like this would happen, as David is a very stubborn man. I told Ash and she was very upset, but I assured her it’s not her fault. In any case, she has an appointment with the therapist on Friday, so hopefully that will be help. If anyone has ever dealt with something like this, as a parent or as a child, I would appreciate any advice or comments on your experience. I want to make it clear to Ash that this is not her fault, but I know it is human nature to blame yourself for things.
&gt;
&gt;TL;DR: My husband was rigid and refused to apologize or see a therapist. He is out of the house and we are getting separated unless he is willing to change. Ash is going to see a therapist.  
&gt;
&gt;EDIT: Some of you are wondering why divorce was such a quick option for me. Our relationship has had some problems and isn't the strongest. He verbally abused me, and I considered divorce many times. We had actually discussed it and had many arguments before Ash was even 10. But I wanted Ash to be safe and happy in a two-parent home, and I wanted her to be around her friends and raised in a home with a steady income. He hadn't abused my daughter AT ALL before this happened. This was the push that led me to finally make a change. 
&gt;
&gt;A few other notes:
&gt;-Yes, he is Ash's biological father. However, he wasn't in Ash's life in a big way until she was three years old, as we were having some severe relationship problems at the time. It is possible that he never truly bonded with her but he hadn't abused her until this time. I have considered the fact that his recent violent mood swings are due to out of control diabetes but I just don't know.
&gt;-Ash has a BMI of about 24. A little higher than usual for her age, but perfectly normal. Please stop insulting her and belittling her weight. God knows she's had enough of that. 
&gt;
&gt;EDIT 2: I forgot to add above that I appreciate your feedback and your help. To those of you who say I didn't do it soon enough, you're right. I have to atone for that. If you say that I am getting a divorce because of Internet comments, that is not true, and you should read what I said above. Your comments gave me some excellent advice. You also gave me the right avenues to looking up more information about this situation. I would not have posted if I wasn't at least contemplating the concept of divorce. The comments gave me the final push I needed.",longtail,t5_2y2kz,1

alviswaite,"I don't know what I can do though. I do work out quite a lot and try to look better. I know how to lose weight. I was anorexic for about a year and it worked like a charm (not advocating anorexia). Building muscle is proving to be much harder. There's no real reason to think that getting a hobby would allow me to get into relationships with the opposite sex. Maybe it could improve my odds slightly, but I don't even know if that's the case. With these women it was incredibly obvious to me that there was one thing that they needed to do and they would be able to expand their dating options exponentially, and there is a clear tried and true path towards reaching that goal. I couldn't understand why they just didn't do that. They wouldn't have to devote any time to it really, just cut down on calorie intake. Even exercising is optional. I know there has to be a reason this was not feasible for them, but I am just saying I didn't understand it. ",ForeverAlone,t5_2s3yz,1
TheLadyEve,"Nope, just morally superior. 

&gt;OP says her daughter is not ""under any definition of the word, fat."" and then goes on a paragraph later to say that she ""started looking a little chubbier"" That doesn't compute.

13-year-olds often go through that extra weight gain while they're also growing taller, and typically if diet and exercise are healthy, it all works out. In fact, that fat is important to keeping them healthy and keeping them growing. 13 is also the prime time for the development of disordered eating. The primary source of influence comes from parents (the modeling the parents show in their own eating and body image) and in comments by peers (which is rarely fun when you're 13). Then you have media influence, which presents unachievable images of ""beauty"" that can cause a child to become depressed and, even worse, obsessed with meeting those standards. I get it--you want to raise your kid healthy. This is how you don't do that:

&gt;At dinner, he told her to “lay off the potatoes” and that no boy would ever like her looking like she does

So this isn't about health--it's about how she looks and whether or not she will be found attractive by her male peers. Once it gets away from it being a healthy eating issue, it becomes an obsessive quest to fit the aesthetic standards of the male gaze in order to gain acceptance. 

And the bulimia comment. Christ. I've treated bulimics who were so sick they vomited blood and had diarrhea at the same time. A few of them had family members who pushed laxatives on them to help ""take off some of those pounds!"" at the age of 14. Please note, I'm not saying families cause eating disorders. There are family factors that contribute to how they are maintained, but typically it's an epigenetic phenomenon that causes imbalances of certain neurotransmitters and hormones, but when it manifests specifically as an eating disorder there simply have to be environmental factors involved that contribute to behaviors. 

EDIT: and I know this long but hang in--the thinspiration and pro-ana stuff is just the tip of the iceberg. The quicker someone gets into therapy the shorter the recovery will be. I think it's great that she's going to therapy--the family needs to all to family therapy together, too, because anorexia and bulimia are family problems. They have a biological base, but the family system reinforces specific behaviors and self-concepts, and the modelling provided by the parents in terms of their own eating is *huge*.

pixelnote,"Hey there! A couple things I would say is, if you don't like your therapist, find a new one. While there is a chance you can solve your OCD on your own, most of the time a therapist is really helpful. Shop around, don't feel like your married to the first therapist you see. Also, ask new therapists if they do evidence-based therapy (which will include stuff like ERP). 

Next, it sounds like your current therapist is trying to get you to do [mindfulness meditation](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-courage-be-present/201001/how-practice-mindfulness-meditation). I could be wrong, but that's about the only thing I can think of that involves observing your thoughts. Other therapists who utilize ERP may tell you to observe your thoughts and report back so that they can target triggers more effectively (which is why being as honest as possible about obsessions and such are beneficial to ERP).  

Finally, as to Luvox, it doesn't seem to actually cause weight gain (quite the opposite, in fact, as it has a warning for ""unintentional"" anorexia). Since I am not your GP or psychiatrist, I don't want to give you too much advice relating to this, but what my psychiatrist told me when putting me on some stuff was that the prescription was an option she was giving me. That's all GPs, psychiatrists, and therapists are; *options*. Only you really know you the best, so it's ultimately up to you to decide what you think is right for you. Medication has worked out well for me, but it's definitely not something I plan on staying on forever, and getting a prescription filled is not a guarantee you'll be medicated forever. 

Finally (part 2), for me, OCD does not really go away no matter how busy I am. Things can just randomly cause an attack, and cause me to more or less shut down, which sucks. That's why I'm currently taking medication, because I don't want to have to deal with that right now. I am also in ERP, so I will hopefully get off medication once I can control it better without the meds. Additionally most SSRIs have a ""ramp up"" period of about 3 weeks for the medication to start to take effect. After that, I haven't experienced many side effects. Again, though, only you know you the best. 

Good luck! You can make it though this!",OCD,t5_2qvqm,1

hockey_puck,"Basically. Think of it this way: if you had a community of people who thought being transgendered was just fine, got transgendered people everything they needed to realize their transitions, and otherwise supported them 100% in their goal, no one would be harmed. If you had a community of people who were 100% devoted to helping anorexics achieve their goals of being as thin as they want to be, a lot of people would end up dead. Anorexia without treatment has grievous, often permanent or fatal effects on the body due to lack of nutrients.

Burntongue,"Being transgender is often viewed as a medical condition--gender dysphoria. It's caused by your brain expecting you to have different primary and secondary sex characteristics than you do, and causes extreme stress when, for example, someone with a brain mapped for a flat chest encounters breasts. It's kind of comparable to phantom limbs, where your body expects you to have a limb you no longer do. 

The difference is that there's no known way to convince the brain to map properly with the body of a person who has gender dysphoria. The best treatment is sex reassignment--and sometimes it's enough to just have top surgery and leave the genitals alone. The issue is neurological, but not a mental illness like anorexia, it is more physical, so the solution is physical as well.

Anorexia is a mental illness. Even though it's similar in the way we interpret it, the cause is different. The brain isn't expecting a skinny body and then experiencing a fat one. Although many people with anorexia have extremely skinny bodies that they think are too fat, this is more of an anxiety rather than dysphoria. As far as I know, the cause isn't exactly known and can range from a number of things from a desire to have control to paranoia about being fat to extreme perfectionism to pathological obsessiveness. Since it is a mental illness caused by disordered thinking, psychiatry and psychotherapy are the best treatments.

I hope that made sense, but tl;dr the difference is: Trangender/gender dysphoria is cured by gender reassignment, but anorexia is not cured or even slightly lessened by losing weight. One is a physical disorder of the brain, one is a mental disorder of the thinking.",AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,5

cosmichobo,"Can confirm people with anorexia nervosa tend to smell like this. The skin dries very easily (as the body cuts down production of oil &amp; fat is not being taken in at the right amount in the diet) and this tends to lead to skin falling off often, wherein which a smell tends to emit as it builds up.

I would like to note this is in the 'end stage' of starvation, so to speak. It's a critical point where this smell typically occurs, and showering itself can be difficult if oedema begins because of a poor working heart. It's very hard with the body dysmorphia and the enlargened body due to water. And, you know. Being naked. God.

Not all anoretics have exercise addiction either like I do. She may have a co-morbidity of depression alongside the possible eating disorder. Avoiding food, however, could be linked to the depression. it can be hard to tell and is usually best done by a doctor, which, I'll add, it's extremely fucking difficult to take anoretics to the doctors.

Basically, excluding the physical and verbal abuse, she would:

1) Refuse to cook dinner on a week night. Apparently, she was 'too tired' after work to cook dinner for her 10 year old daughter and 5 year old son. I cooked dinner pretty much most nights from the age of 10. 

2) When she did cook us dinner, it was either; noodles, pizza or ginger and cabbage soup. My mum had severe anorexia and lived off nothing/soup. 

3) She would enforce me to have my hair cut into a bob, which she would do herself. She clipped my ear with scissors once whilst doing it, and I had to get 2 stitches. 

4) During summer holidays, she would send my younger brother to summer camp (he was her golden boy) and she would work every day from 7am until 7pm. She refused to give me a house key, which meant that I was stuck in the house alone, pretty much all day. 

5) She used to lock me into my bedroom in the nights.

6) I once asked her if I could 'feed my pet fish' and she slapped me across the face. 

7) Regardless of the abuse, I was an A+ student and excelled in all aspects of school, sport and music. My mum never acknowledged this and never went to parents evening.

8) She kicked me out of the house when I was 12 because I was 'getting on her nerves'.

9) If she'd had a bad day at work, she would come home, cry, eat about 2-3 full packs of biscuits and then purge them all up, whilst me and my brother could hear everything.

10) She would never clean the house, meaning that I used to clean it almost everyday. If I missed a day, she would go nuts and accuse me of being lazy.

11) She wouldn't comfort my brother if he was crying as a baby, that was up to me.

12) She would abuse our dog, Rosie (who was my bestfriend). She then proceeded to get rid of her, for no reason, and then brought another dog a few weeks later. 

13) She was a hoarder and our house was always cluttered with her books, paper work etc. 

14) She poisoned our neighbours dog because it was barking too loudly.

15) She also put nails on somebody's driveway in order to puncture their tires.

However, I will point out that her anorexia, her cheating behavior, and her substance abuse can ALL be linked back to her sexual assault as a child and that, through hard work and treatment, it is possible that she can be healed. Understand: she did all of this because she was reacting to a trauma that few people can comprehend. Very likely one or both of her parents experienced the same thing when they were young. 

My advice would be that if she is in treatment, and she is taking it seriously, and doing the (very) hard work, she may be worthy of a second chance. You'll very likely have to go to some group sessions with her, and these will be very uncomfortable for you.

Attendez_La_Creme_Fu,"No throwaway because I don't care, sorry for my bad English.

When I was in school I was violently bullied for being 'different'. My parents were somewhat rich, so I always loked better than the rest of my classmates. I was also very picky in my friendship choices, so I rejected the most popular girls friendship offers. I matured faster that other girls, no gigantic boobs or anything, but I looked curvy and 'grown up'. I was beaten up, spat on, laughed at in front of teachers, who did nothing, but stand and watch, I was thrown into trashcan - I was humiliated in every possible way. I was called 'fat, 'ugly', I was told no one would ever date me. They would inmmitate my voice and my gestures, making it into a joke, Some boys even had a notebook filled with things I said or did, that they could've used against me. I was 'booed' every time I stepped into the classroom. I was the sweetest child ever at home, or with my parent's friends, or going out, but school became a living nightmare. I developed a severe case of body dysmorphia, then I had a brief period of bulimia and then restrictive eating.

I studied French at school as a third language, our main class teacher (I don't know how to explain it better, but she was 'mentoring' the 28 of us) was also the French teacher. Imagine Dolores Ambridge. No kidding, she was short, fat, with a sickly sweet voice and wore expensive, although not age appropriate clothes (think pink, lace, rhinestones, etc) She always wanted to fit in with us, she would discuss private things, like her new diet, or she would gossip about other teachers (I know, WTF). I can definitely say she must have had some serious mental disorders, because one moment she is calm and inviting, the next one she is screaming her lungs out and crying at the same time. She is a manipulative, mentally abusive, lying bitch. She was the main bully. She would talk with other teachers behind my back, while in class. Loud enough for everyone to hear how short my skirt was, how horribly done my hair is etc. She mentally abused me into depression and anorexia nervosa and straight into sucide ward of a mental institution. The moment I checked in there my weight was 83 pounds, I was dehydrated and miserable. I was dying. Eventually I recovered, the bullying stopped, but something inside me also changed. I became aggressive. I became bitter. I tried to get her fired, but she has some connections, which made this impossible. 

Long story short, the year after I graduated, in summer 2013 I broke into her office. It was late at night, at 3 am, our school has no alarms and her window opens right into the school yard. I broke her laptop, smashed the flower vases, destroyed the paintings, tore the posters, broke the clock, you name it. I destroyed all the documents she had in her table drawers, I smashed the DVD's, I wrecked chaos in there. I smashed her IPad. I cut her expensive leather chair, I scratched the floor, the walls, the door. I would've done it again. The anger boils inside of me as I type this out. 

The damage I've caused was estimated to be at least 4000 dollars. She has no insurance and the school will not cover anything. Yes, the police was involved, but there was no evidence identifying who did that. But I hope she knows. I want her to know it was me. I'll never forgive her. I'll never forget. She destroyed me. She gave me a lifelong of mental and physical issues. 

No shame here. If someone found it was me it could destroy my life, but I live in a different city now, far from her, so my secret is safe for now.

It's very clear you don't want to be involved with your wife any longer, although I'm not sure why adultery alone is an adequate reason.

You can offer your wife — repeat, your *wife* — the support she needs to improve her life, improve the eating disorders, go through rehabilitative treatment, go through PTSD treatment.  But you can't guarantee it will ever be successful, and you certainly can't tell her she needs to do these things so that you can divorce her.

What it sounds like she needs is most likely dialectical behavioral therapy.  It's very common for people with borderline personalities to have a history of trauma and PTSD, and they *will* sabotage their own lives because they are that convinced nothing good will ever happen to them that they make sure nothing good lasts very long.  It's messed up, but it's a pathology thing.

You want her to be stable enough to provide a meaningful female role model for her 9-year-old daughter, *you* need to ensure she gets treatment, and *you* need to step up to the plate as an involved, very-full-time father.

You wouldn't be the first single father with custody of a daughter, and you certainly wouldn't be the last, but if you continue to hate your wife so intensely, your daughter will eventually begin to hate herself, especially whenever she acts like her own mother in the slightest.  No man should ever be a misogynist, but *certainly* no father of a daughter should dare be misogynist, because if you are, you're going to see your daughter end up with a husband who treats her terribly.

The mature, intelligent, reasonable response is to disengage emotionally as well as, possibly, legally, and stop hating her.  Stop calling her a cunt.  Jesus. 

Go to counseling, either with her to begin discussing your relationship — which cannot end.  You can stop being *married* and you can stop *sleeping* with her, but as she is the mother of your child, you two are locked in a *permanent* relationship — or you can go alone, to discuss what you thought you were getting out of this relationship, what you hope for future relationships, ways in which you enabled this behavior, unintentionally or no, and strategies for parenting your daughter well.

Bear in mind that your wife, whether you like it or not, has provided many models for your daughter, and always will, and therefore, any investment in improving *her* mental health and personal stability will pay off threefold for your daughter.

ihatewetsocks,"I believe she loves you so much, but she hates herself. Developing self worth is one of the biggest hurdles in recovery because disordered eating patients think of themselves as worthless pieces of shit that don't deserve to live. It's so hard because you love her but you're so hurt too.

What she did wasn't right - what she did was SO wrong, but I remember having meaningless sex with men because it made me feel better. In reality though, it never filled that hole inside of me and I felt more terrible about myself and my anorexia got more out of control. 

She's got the capacity to love, to be a great mom, and to thrive, but anorexia is a form of a mental health disorder. Work on yourself, be there for your daughter, and get some counseling because eating disorders don't just affect the one suffering from it. Your daughter might also benefit because she's at such an impressionable age as well and it might help her work through some of her concerns, fears, etc.

There's an amazing book that really helped me through recovery, and my boyfriend too. It's called ""Life Without Ed"" and it really gives you an inside look at what a person with an eating disorder is going through and thinking.

temeraie,"I told you the difference. They **should** feel awful. Fat people need to stop telling themselves that they look great and that everyone should love them for their awesome personalities, none of it is true. They look like shit, they have trouble with basic movements and are probably going to die at 40. The personality argument is bullshit anyway, being disgusting does not grant you any bonuses except maybe for extra bitterness and shame.

Lying and encouraging them to love themselves just the way they are is much more harmful than any ""bullying"". At least dealing with bullying, [some of them might say 'enough' and change their lifestyle](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate/comments/2u0uof/fat_shaming_works_man_loses_21_stone_294_lbs/). Telling them that everything's cool, however, is morally wrong as it's just giving a pass for self-harm. We don't tolerate anorexia, cutting or doing drugs, why is eating yourself to death seen as okay? Do you consider yourself a logical or rational person? 

Shaming fit people, on the other hand, is only done out of pure spite and envy, there's absolutely no argument that could be used to defend this.

I don't believe anyone should just accept himself just as he is, not this way. It's great to love yourself, but at the same time we should strive for improvement. If you're wrong, you need to be called out on it, so you can grow as a person. Everything about being fat is wrong and it's not an opinion. It's been proven numerous times how harmful obesity is, and these fat people? They're like children covering their ears in an attempt to not hear the ugly truth. 

I don't run from any discussion because I'm not afraid to have my views challenged, they don't define me! I can change my mind and my ways. But being fat.. is like walking with a neon sign saying that you don't care about facts and you don't face your problems. Not only do I not want to be any close with people like that, **I despise them** and I certainly do not need to know anything more about them.

Your daughter is a preteen now, but she's pretty much on the cusp of getting to that age where girls start becoming very self conscious of their bodies and your wife is in a very bad place to be an actual parent for her. Even if she is careful to not enforce negative attitudes (I.e, she is carefully to not use body shaming language, etc), her own habits, like not eating or obsessive calorie counting, are gonna rub off on your daughter and signal to her that having unhealthily obsessive habits like your wife might be normal or desirable. That isn't to say that women who have been anorexic in the past are unfit parents, but your wife is in and out of the hospital all the time, and she seems like she can barely deal with herself, much less a kid. I feel like your wife absolutely needs to be in counseling or working on getting her anorexia in control before you can even begin to consider her to be a fully there parent, especially with the drug abuse. If you fight for custody (which you should), could you hire a nanny or lean on family members to look after your kid if you're away? ",relationships,t5_2qjvn,14

But guess what - and I know it's cliché to say - but it gets better. So much better. It takes time and support and therapy and a dietician and sometimes pills. But it does really improve. I know that I'll never be fully recovered, because that's impossible - it's a part of my past and thus, it is a part of me. But now I can eat and I can exercise and I can look in the mirror and love myself, sure it took a fuckload of time and a fuckload of tears and a fuckload of therapy. But I got there.

I know all about the lying and I know you feel like crap. I still feel as though I'm repaying my parents for all the pain I caused them, the trust I betrayed and the whirlwind I threw the whole family in. But they will know that you weren't truly being yourself, because you let the disease take over your life. They will forgive you, though they will never forget.

Like I said, it takes time and effort but it's possible. You're a bit broken but you can be fixed and the cracks can be covered. If you aren't seeing a therapist yet - start. Make sure you have a connection with the person and that you can tell him or her everything, in time - honesty is important here.

I wasn't able to open up and tell her everything all at once. I managed to work up the courage to say something very vague, like 'I've been having some problems with food'. After that, she asked a lot of questions and managed to get the details from me. I find it's much easier to answer questions than to just volunteer information. Also, psychologists and psychiatrists are there to help you. They won't judge or be mad that you didn't say something sooner. They'll be glad that you said something at all.

It's good that you recognize that you have a problem. I was in denial for a very long time. The more you want to get better, the more likely you are to improve.

Don't be anorexic, then. I don't know anyone in *real life* who encourages anorexia.

Because there's *always* someone ""better than you"" when you compare yourself to other people in that way.

But back to my point, how does ""m-m-muh unrealistic standards of beauty"" in any way justify morbid obesity? It doesn't. You're still abusing your body. Forget about beauty, because this isn't about being attractive. This is about *health* and you can't STAY healthy being morbidly obese. You can temporarily BE healthy because you're still too young to have felt the ill effects of morbid obesity, but those health problems will be coming because they are a natural consequence of so much extra weight.

cheyday,"I know this post is a little over a month old already, but I'm about to throw out a line and see if I can get a catch! 

22/F/5'9"" I'm a newish ketoer. Paleo fanatic for almost 5 years. I was doing ketosis while living on Hawaii for a few months in 2012 after I took on Dave Asprey's take on ""Bulletproof"". After some misinformation and his whole controversy, I went back to regular Paleo (sans BPC) but also gained back all of my weight. I don't know how to post the bar of my stats next to my name, as I see the comments below, but my starting weight: 170, current weight: 168, goal weight: 150. I've been struggling with inconsistency in diets for the last 4-5 years, yo-yoing constantly and having  an endless addiction to sugar, which in turn has been effective in continuing the eating disorder that I struggle with; bulimia (and I suffered from anorexia when I was 16, recovering in almost twice the amount of weight). 

After countless trial and error, ketosis seems like the only thing I can manage to the best of my abilities and proves the best results, not only aesthetically, but mentally I feel an immediate decrease in brain fog and hardly sluggish (except in the keto flu stage). However, I do like the bulletproof coffee, so I don't think that's going anywhere out of my diet cause it's too freaking delicious! 

I'm completely new to reddit as well, so I'm still trying to figure out all the bells and whistles of the whole gambit. I primarily joined reddit just because I saw how much keto info there was, so thank you to everyone who has helped me with my questions thus far! 

Right now I'm on day 15, I lost 4 pounds in the first week, back tracked and gained back 2 pounds (after some mistakes were made when eating out), so now I gotta start the ketosis all over again. I'm like the many new ketoers in that I'm paranoid in going over my carbs, but if I happen to go over 30 I begin to rationalize that between 40-50g is good, even though I know that full ketosis is not in effect unless it's under 30. As of right now I've had some dizzy spells with having plenty of water since about 3 days ago, some fatigue, and definitely an unusual amount of rank breath...so could that mean I'm still in ketosis ?

Regarding the previous paragraph, is there any advice on staying motivated or what to stick with when eating out? I'm getting frustrated already because I can't seem to stay below 30 and it seems so dogmatic in that if you cheat it seems like the end of the world! Obviously I can't be optimal if I'm not fully in ketosis but I can't be the only one struggling with this issue. 

Also, I'm getting mixed information on the whole ""net carbs"" vs. 30 carbs straight. Is it nothing over 30 carbs to the T, or am I able to go over slightly if I subtract my fiber carbs ? 

Lastly, since starting keto I can't freaking poop! I've always had IBS issues but Paleo and cutting out gluten had helped in that way tremendously. But, now that there are even less vegetables I'm lucky if I can have a smooth execution once a day :( Help !

With the internet we are constantly viewing the absolute extreme of both anorexia and obesity, so it's very easy to get perspectives skewed. 

Doctors seem like they treat enough people that they have a good perspective. I'd trust his word over what others say. 50 years ago skinny was the norm, so really ""skinny"" today is probably pretty bulky for 40 years ago. Go into ANY gym in America and there's bound to be at least a few people who would have a promising career as a ""strong man"" 40 years ago, but are fairly common today.

Don't get me wrong, it's hard, REALLY hard to train yourself to ignore it, especially those who are weaker in the self-control department.

Secondly, if you see most fashion models in real life, they aren't exactly societies beauty standard. Victoria's secret models maybe, but not high up in the fashion industry.

Wow, I've never heard of that.  Though characterising it as ""promoting mental illness"" still seems a bit wrong to me, as I doubt whether you can acquire anorexia nervosa by reading a website where people say it's great.  All kinds of physical and mental health problems have associated denialist groups.  I'm not sure how this has anything to do with ""SJWs"" or ""political correctness"", though.  Lots of people think it would be a good idea to try and destigmatize mental illness, but that's not the same thing as denying that mental illnesses are mental illnesses.

This is mostly something you hear from people mocking trans people.

you say:

&gt;I am currently overweight. I was at a healthy weight for 7 years of my adult life. During this time, I counted calories religiously (no more than 1800/day!), exercised regularly, avoided food prepared by others (this kills the social life), and ate a ton of vegetables. One day I stopped giving a fuck and stopped counting calories while still eating mostly healthy and exercising. I gained 60 pounds in a year and stabilized around a BMI of 29 for 1 year. I'm currently working hard to lose those 60 pounds. After I hit my goal weight, I expect to count calories for the rest of my life to maintain it.
I'm astounded that some women could accomplish what I did by working and sacrificing, without trying at all. I'm wondering whether this is the norm or the exception. I'm interested to hear from ladies who are currently a healthy weight (whether you used to be fat or not), how or if you work to maintain it.

do you really not know that EDs are very much about numbers and counting and controling food as a form of controling your life?

DrunkenBlowfish,"I have anorexia, depression, OCD, generalized anxiety disorder, and BDD (body dysmorphic disorder).

Anorexia feels like a distinct voice in my head. Perfectionist, controlling, type-A. Think Angela from the office. But she only really cares about what I eat, what other people see me eat, how much I exercise, and what I weigh. If I don't meet these expectations, I want to kill myself. When I do meet expectations, I feel like I should have done better. It feels like crying when you see food and worrying about what lies you have to tell to avoid it. It feels like hatred for yourself and love for that wicked voice in your head. 

OCD a lot of people have touched on already, but it feels like fucking mind control (actually similar to OCD since they are so commonly found together). I feel like I honestly can't control my thoughts and if I don't follow through with my compulsions, I feel like I will have a panic attack or the world will end.

Depression feels different for me depending on a lot of different things. Usually it manifests itself as anger for me (not violent, but just hatred for life and the fact that I'm here). Other times it's literally balling my eyes out and staying in bed for days, not showering and zero motivation. It feels like your life doesn't matter. It feels like someone is twisting my heart out and suffocating me. Physically exhausting and painful to pretend that it's not happening or to hide from others.

BDD feels similar to OCD but all related to my appearance. When i go out of the house, all I can think about is how I look and what other people are thinking about me. Mine's related to my face shape so I've spent hours and hours researching plastic surgeons. I can't focus on anything expect my appearance and it really hinders my social life and relationships. When I do go out in public i have trouble concentrating on what others are talking about (even at work or in class) because I'm thinking about what angle I should sit at or how my hair is covering my face, etc. I feel the need to check my appearance frequently either with taking pictures of myself (because i feel like I can't see the real me in the mirror for some reason) or by going to the bathroom to fix how I look.
