 [**Brutalist architecture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist%20architecture): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Brutalist architecture__ is a movement in architecture that flourished from the 1950s to the mid-1970s, descended from the [modernist architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_architecture) movement of the early 20th century. The term does not derive from the word ""brutal"", but originates from the French *béton brut*, or ""raw concrete"", a term used by [Le Corbusier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier) to describe his choice of material. [British architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_United_Kingdom) critic [Reyner Banham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reyner_Banham) adapted the term into ""brutalism"" (originally ""New Brutalism"") to identify the emerging style.

&gt;Brutalism became popular with governmental and institutional clients, with numerous examples in Britain, France, Germany, Japan, the United States, Canada, Brazil, the Philippines, and Australia. Examples are typically massive in character (even when not large), [fortress-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortification), with a predominance of exposed [concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete) construction, or in the case of the ""brick brutalists"" ruggedly detailed brickwork and concrete together. There is often an emphasis on graphically expressing in the external elevations and in the whole-site plan the main functions and people-flows of the buildings. Brutalism became popular for educational buildings (especially university buildings), but was relatively rare for corporate projects. Brutalism became favoured for many government projects, high-rise housing, and [shopping centres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_mall) to create an architectural image that communicated strength, functionality, and frank expression of materiality.

&gt;In its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy, Brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of some 1930s and 1940s architecture. In one critical appraisal by Banham, Brutalism was posited not as a style at all but as the expression of an atmosphere among architects of moral seriousness. ""Brutalism"" as an architectural critical term was not always consistently used by critics; architects themselves usually avoided using it altogether. More recently, ""brutalism"" has become used in popular discourse to refer to buildings of the late twentieth century that are large or unpopular – as a synonym for ""brutal"" – making its effective use in architectural historical discourse problematic.

&gt;__Welfare queen__ is a [pejorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative) phrase used in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America) to refer to people, usually women, who are accused of collecting excessive [welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_(financial_aid\)) payments through fraud or manipulation. Reporting on welfare fraud began during the early 1960s, appearing in general interest magazines such as *[Readers Digest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers_Digest)*. The term entered the American [lexicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon) during [Ronald Reagan's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan) [1976 presidential campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States\)_presidential_primaries,_1976) shortly after he described [a woman abusing welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Taylor) from [Chicago's South Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Side_(Chicago\)), but he never used the term ""welfare queen"" when referencing the woman.

&gt;A __pole of inaccessibility__ marks a location that is the most challenging to reach owing to its remoteness from [geographical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography) features that could provide access. Often it refers to the most distant point from the coastline. The term describes a geographic construct, not an actual physical phenomenon.

 [**Winged scapula**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged%20scapula): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;A __winged scapula__ (__scapula alata__) is a condition in which the shoulder blade, or shoulder bone, protrudes from a person’s back in an abnormal position. It is a rare condition with the potential to lead to limited functional activity in the upper extremity to which it is adjacent. It can affect a person’s ability to lift, pull, and push weighty objects. In some serious cases, the ability to perform [activities of daily living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living) such as changing one’s clothes and washing one’s hair may be hindered. The name of this condition comes from its appearance, a wing-like resemblance, due to the [medial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomical_terms#Anatomical_directions) border of the [scapula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_blade) sticking straight out from the back. Scapular winging has been observed to disrupt [scapulohumeral rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapulohumeral_muscles), contributing to decreased [flexion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion) and [abduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_(kinesiology\)) of the upper extremity, as well as a loss in power and the source of considerable pain.  A winged scapula is considered normal posture in young children, but not older children and adults.

* Clicking on a spawn location and either 1) spawning underground in a completely different location, 2) spawning in the middle of nowhere, 3) dropping out of the sky and falling to your death.. in the middle of nowhere.
* Random invisible walls blocking shots when I have a clear line of sight. Happened twice yesterday when I was using the SAS-R. Once was under a bridge, and another while on a rooftop farming a sunderer. Both times I had nothing blocking my view, but when I fired, I would see sparks fly in front of me and hear the glass shattering sound effect that indicated I'd shot a wall. Wtf?
* Severe server lag. I'm talking, dying to people after I've killed them. I also killed somebody with an EM6 after I had already died and switched loadouts to a GD7-F. Movement seems warpy, people moving extra fast. It feels as though the server is trying to ""catch up"" and suddenly moves the player models forward extra fast. 
* Been having the cloak glitch a lot. When infil, it gets stuck in this weird half-cloaked phase and I can't tell if I'm really cloaked or not. On HA, I occasionally get stuck glowing even when my shield is off.

We know there are two pigments essentially a brown and red pigment that make up hair color. I'm pretty sure that the amount of red is controlled by 1 gene ( but MANY different alleles. ) We are not sure how many genes are involved in the amount of brown pigment. We just don't know enough to be able to predict offspring hair color.

The semi finals are held at the competing sides grounds and matches that end in a draw go into Extra time and penalties if required.

The FA Cup is contested by every professional football club in both England and Wales and it runs from August to May. However the lower league sides have to go through many qualifying rounds until they eventually hit the First Round (which is called the First round proper) which is where the Leagues 1 and 2 sides enter. 

Eventually they hit the 3rd round and that's where the Championship and PL sides automatically enter (so there are 64 teams in Third Round proper). 

Matches that end in a draw are replayed about two weeks later at the away sides ground (example, United vs Arsenal ends 1-1 at Old Trafford the replay is at the Emirates) and if there is another draw it goes to extra time and penalties. 

Unlike the League Cup there is no two legged semi final. The semi final is played at Wembley with the final also played at Wembley. 

Long post but there you go. The League Cup isn't taken as seriously by bigger teams (hence why Sunderland, Swansea, Bradford, Cardiff and Birmingham have been finalists in the last 4 years) but the FA Cup is always regarded as the best cup competition in the world due to its rich history.

You can see from most of the comments already that the theme with the TAZ is frustration yet in the end they're glad they went with it.  Once you do find the sweet spot though it's a beast of a printer that has no problems printing 24/7.  In fact Lulzbot prints 24/5 with over a hundred of them.  As /u/jebba said in another thread there's a new all metal hotend very close to production likely about the same time as their new mini printer.  I'm sure the TAZ 5 will have the improvements such as the self leveling system and new hotend.

I can't say anything really bad about Makerbot's 2/2x.  They have their own issues but once you work on them a bit they're solid workhorses.  The 5th gens... stay away for now.

MakerGear M2 is a really solid printer.  I know a few people who own them and if you look at 3dhub's guide the printer is very well liked.

A printer I would highly suggest is an Ultimaker 2.  It has a smaller build volume than the TAZ but it's far less picky with settings.  It's my first choice when printing most of the time just because it works with minimal fuss and can print faster at the same quality levels.  With ninjaflex and composite ninjaflex/ABS parts the TAZ wins hands down though.

If you can accept the build volume the Flashforge Creator Pro is a nice choice and very well built.  Any part that has a higher potential failure rate is easy to replace and spares are on their site.  It doesn't hold your hand when it comes to documentation though.",3Dprinting,t5_2rk5q,2.0,

So, the result of that is that this CPU is going to just sit there and go to waste, while the video card will be huffing and puffing, straining at the seams.

Drop the CPU down to a non-overclock i5-4460 or 4590, and bump the video card up to at least a Radeon R9 280 or 280X, and you'll be playing every modern-day game at a smooth 60 FPS on High/Ultra settings -- for nearly the same price. If you stick with the build you have already chosen for yourself, you'd be lucky if you got 30-40 FPS on High, and some of the newer games will need to be bumped down to Medium to stay above 30-40 (which is a minimum, by any PC gaming standard). Of course the fact that you don't have a 1080p monitor is certainly going to help you reach higher framerates, but do you really want to limit yourself like that? Surely at some point you'll want a better monitor (they're only about $120-130 for a high-quality IPS LED), and your hardware won't be able to keep up with it.

If your intention is to play video games on this PC, you're making a big mistake. I urge you to heed my advice on how to allocate your resources for better overall performance. You don't need to sacrifice a quad-core processor, just don't be getting the most expensive one of the bunch, it doesn't fit the rest of your specs.

These abilities on the enemy are in my opinion a great addition to the game. I've been running massive amounts of T4 missions recently because of how insanely fun it has become. However, this is also because I have high RoF weapons in my T4 load out. The nullifiers and eximi shields need to follow the rules placed onto player controlled Globes. This means, explosive munitions I.e. Penta nades, Ogris rockets or blast procs need to affect the enemies within the shield as they do on players. Or conversely players should finally be immune to procs coming from outside the globe and into it. Another thing DE should consider is removing the damage limit on shields. Its pretty ridiculous how high RoF weapons are better against Nullifier shields (I've noticed this is only on Nullifiers) that slow high damage weapons. To put this into perspective, my Boltor Prime shoots spikes that deal ~800 damage to the nullifier shields. My opticor deals 8640 damage to the shields yet it always takes around a full opticor mag, 5 shots (~9 shots with multishot) to take the shield down. DE needs to remove the damage limit the shields can take from one damage source allowing the viability of both high RoF and slow RoF weapons to be viable.An idea I've been tinkering with is to make the shields susceptible to weapon procs. Blast procs can CC enemies inside the shield while Magnetic procs can deal more damage to the shield itself. By introducing this mechanic, Void missions become more dynamic as players have to choose when and where to switch weapons.TL;DR 1) unify rules with regard to out of body shields. Players should be able to affect enemies in shield or be immune to them inside their own.2) Remove damage limit on shields to make slow RoF weapons viable against nullifiers.3) Add elemental weaknesses to the shields, bringing more variety to weapon elemental choices in the void.",Warframe,t5_2urg0,2.0,

An opt-out system requires a lot of paperwork and process serving, and legal judgments. It is also difficult to manage - what if a woman doesn't tell a man she's pregnant, then later gives birth and claims child support? He says he was never told, she says that he was told. Now you have a legal case, etc. 

An opt-out system would eliminate all of that. No process serving is needed. If a woman doesn't tell the man about pregnancy, well, he can't be forced to pay. So there is no incentive to abuse the system - in fact, there is no way to abuse the system.

&gt;In fact, they have to do with a system which actively compels everyone else to pick up the tab. 

An opt-in system does not solve the money issue. It solves the practicality issue of how financial abortions could feasibly work.

&gt;You're arguing that forcing someone to pay for the child is wrong in one circumstance, but totally fine in another.

Requiring everyone to pay a very small amount for all kids (taxes), is just. Forcing a man to pay a large amount for a kid he never wanted, after he was raped or deliberately deceived, is unjust.

But we are digressing. My claim is that no woman has ever been forced to pay for a child she never raised. If one example is ever found of such a woman, I will change my view on that.

I have been posing this question for years, but no one has ever provided such a woman.

I'm a 23 year old junior in college studying to become a software engineer while minoring in metaphysical philosophy at NIU.

My first COD, and first FPS game period actually was BO2. I know, I'm WAY late to the party but I followed that game very closely outside of competitive because it was new to me &amp; I'm too competitive to suck at something but not do something about it. Thanks to /u/Drift0r's in depth series I got a really good grasp on the how the game worked pretty quickly and am pretty much a stat junkie in every game I play now.

Ghosts was the first game I watched competitively, and I'm drained. I've watched 4 AW streams, just can't get into it like I was before :/

I'm actually a bigger Battlefield fan than COD &amp; I'm ironically a lot better at it too. I once ranked first in the state of Illinois in skill &amp; score per minute. I haven't played in months though so I'm sure my ranks have plummeted.

Outside of the FPS stuff I listen to a LOT of music (15 different genres and sub genres) &amp; watch sports constantly, my favorite being baseball (White Sox). That's pretty much me.",CoDCompetitive,t5_2tvg8,2.0,

I deliberately made Arcane Unraveling do nothing in aggressive match-ups (although technically it could net value with Mad Scientist), because I think it is just insane in games that go to fatigue. All the cards you mentioned are no doubt key in control, but 5 additional cards, 5 turns when you're not taking fatigue, seems absolutely insane to me. Also, this card only get better in time as more cards that interact with Secrets and have Mad Scientist-esque effects into the game. I'd gladly agree that no one would ladder with this card, but I think against control it could be insanely useful.

I think Shadow Summoner doesn't produce an insane amount of burn at all; you pay 9 mana just to get the first Shadow Bomber on board (6 for the card, 2 for hero power, 1 for the Bomber), and you can only Hero Power once per turn. If you have pressure to go along with it, then yes, it will do work, but on its own I don't think it's that strong at all.

For Tinkerer, I imagined this card less as a Jeeves (who simply allows any class to be zoo) and more like a mini-Gazlowe. I think if you even have two cards on board that generate Spare Parts (like a Gnome and Yeti) and you trade them in, this card gives you value. Two extra Spare Parts with Gazlowe or Antonidas or even Auctioneer is really good, and you're not paying too much to get them. 

Beastmaster can have synergy with Hunter cards obviously, allowing you to Houndmaster anything, enable Kill Command, etc. etc. This can let you do stuff like turn 4 Yeti turn 5 Beastmaster + Houndmaster, or turn 3 Harvest Golem turn 4 coin Beastmaster Houndmaster; basically it allows a work-around for there being a low number of good beasts in the game. It also synergizes with Druid of the Fang, I don't know if that's enough to make Beast Druid viable but I think it's worth considering. And, the most important part for me, it is a vastly superior Black Knight + Mark of the Wild with Hemet Nesingwary; a 6 mana Assassinate that also summons a 6/3 and a 2/1. 

Generator is insane if you can get value from it, but you have to run the Paladin secrets in exchange, which are pretty mediocre. And they won't get amazing value with the board state, except for Avenge; Redemption will be bad if they kill the Generator, Noble Sacrifice won't be spectacular, and the other ones will be garbage as usual.

I'll agree that Shadowy Archer is too strong; do you think making it a 1/2 would be fine (still better than Creeper, but it is a class card)?

For the Tortoise, it does seem limited, but I think in a deck with a lot of card draw, or a deck that can afford to blank on several draws, playing 2/2s over and over and over again will eventually just win you the game. A comparison could be made with Hogger in terms of how 2/2 Taunts can snowball out of control. Also it's a Beast, though I don't know how useful that is.

I didn't consider the Shade comparison with Fel Imp at all, I think its advantage is that it can grow much quicker, when making it I was thinking of the synergy with Floating Watcher; you tap and simultaneously grow both of them at once. Also with Blood Imp on board he grows faster than Shade as well, although not by much. He's probably a much worse play in the early game, but I think when you can play him and a few health-buffing effects immediately he shines.

For Neighborhood Blacksmith, I think the problem with him is that in order for him to be good you have to have a lot of weapons, but then you can't use them all because you have a ton of durability on the one you have. And if you only get a few more charges, then he's pretty comparable to Greenskin;  with 1 minion, he's just worse, with 2 it's arguable (+1/+1 on the weapon but -2 Attack), so it takes 3 minions on board for him to be a better Greenskin. Which for current Warrior decks isn't that easy to achieve.

You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/z08ap/how_you_should_tag_your_r4r_posts/).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/z08ap/how_you_should_tag_your_r4r_posts/).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.
6. [Discussion] - If you are asking the community to contribute and discuss something relevant to everybody.

It should take very little icing possibility to scrap a flight, unless you can absolutely guarantee yourself &gt;37F air below to dive into along your route of flight. Most icing is not a big deal when you can just descend and melt it off. It is a huge, life threatening deal when you have nowhere to go.

As far as non-winter threats, the two main concerns are precipitation inside a cloud formation and winds inside a cloud formation. Precip can be picked up by radar, so ATC can give you a heads up. If they say ""light precip"", no big deal. Moderate precip, try to find a divert around it but probably okay. Heavy/extreme, find somewhere else or turn around. If you have XM weather onboard, it tends to be an overly sensitive radar picture. Fly through green/yellow layers no problem, just avoid anything red or worse. ForeFlight stratus (ADS-B weather) more closely mirrors what ATC sees. Try to avoid yellow and do NOT fly through red. If you see lightning strikes, 20nm minimum divert around it.

For winds inside clouds, best resource is PIREPs because our technology can't really show you what's happening beyond a forecast, but even PIREPs aren't that great when they're 10 minutes old. Pick the cloud that is the shortest; the thicker and taller it is, the more energy it has inside. I try to guesstimate and avoid anything more than a few thousand feet tall. If it has an anvil shaped top then it's a no-go.

Hope that helps, the thunderstorm slalom is how us east coast-ers go places in the summertime...",flying,t5_2qm1t,1.0,

look. I'm eleven days in and I am *committed* but that does **not** mean that you can fucking give up on me. 

&gt;We're failed except you.

you've only failed if you give up nofap. I'd like to post something that I posted on pornfree

""Well, I had been on a 7 day streak then I gave up. I was still motivated so I started again and went on a 22 day. Then I began doubting myself and what I was doing. I watched a few films in that streak and found myself enjoying scenes of sex *more* than usual. This caused it to snowball.

What helped immensely from that streak (my longest) is when an arousing thought hits you, **immediately** shut it down. Don't try to ignore it but rather tell it to fuck off and this next step is key to shutting it down: **move away from your previous room/activity** and do something else.
If you disagree with the thought but don't move away, it'll be like a drug addict telling himself he's going to the store when he's actually heading towards a trap house/drug house.  

I know myself better than anybody else. I find it hard to really register others' feelings when they're trying to motivate me so I made a video where I convince myself in a time of need, to move on. 

This is both to prevent procrastination and watching porn: I leave my phone across my room. Others choose to keep it across the house or in their safe but this is sufficient for me. I use an alarm and it forces me to stand up. Once I am up, I won't go back. 

Lastly, reward and recognise your achievements! Make a vague reward plan. After a week of my new life, I will treat myself to a mcflurry. On the second, I'll get a subway sandwich. On the third, a cinema visit and fourth, a new trouser. Something like that 

Never forget to reread your goals. **Never become complacent**. 

I look forward to seeing our counters rise together as we create a new life for ourselves.""

I get your point.  unfortunately i think you either responded to the wrong topic or got confused - this post was about tight rulesets, not about balance, but you seem to use those interchangably.  You can make tight rules with an unbalanced system, or a balanced system with not tight rules.

If it was about balance, well, warmachine/hordes is one system that supports 14 full factions, and warhammer 40k has 18 (really about 16 if you dont include some armies that are meant to be allies and not full factions).  fantasy doesn't have to be balanced against 40k so it's not included.  So the difference isn't so great.  unless you think the jump from 14 to 16-18 factions really breaks the camels back there, but i cant see it.




But back to the tight ruleset -  warhammer 40k's main rules problem isn't the vast number of rules.  It's not the minute rules interactions.  Really the core problem is the rules aren't written in a systematic fashion.

A systematic rule set lays down terms and uses them to create a complete and bounded system.

40k has decided not to go this route and elects not to fully define terms most of the time, and often uses many similar terms with slight differences to mean the same thing, leading to confusion.

40k rules are written when the rules writer has an idea in mind and jots down what he thought in plain english.  Most games with tight rulesets has the creator think of a rule, then they write it down in the confines of the rules set.

To use an example earlier today - ""a single passenger can fire out of each Fire Point"".  This is a poor rule as it stands, because the timing is not defined, and 40k doesn't even have a definition for what firing means.  do you ""Fire"" psychic shooting attacks?  Are you firing once or twice if you shoot two shots from the same weapon?  are you firing twice if you shoot two different weapons?

A tighter defined rules set would have defined ""fire"" as making a ranged attack, and ranged attacks as psychic, shooting, etc.  It would let you know if that is per phase or per turn or per firing step or what the timing is.

To use an example from a comprehensive ruleset, in magic there's a card that makes all blue lands produce an extra mana.  In 40k it might very well be a psychic power that reads ""All blue lands produce an extra mana"".  

That would be a terrible rule.  produce is not defined, it doesn't say when they make the extra mana (when they produce, do they produce two?  do they produce one now and one at the normal time?).  Theres just a lot of problems with that wording, you know this without even playtesting it.

Thats why magic words it ""Until end of turn, whenever a player taps an Island for mana, that player adds Blue to his or her mana pool""   The timing is defined, tap is a defined term in the rules, everything about the rule uses defined terms and fits perfectly into the ruleset.

Just reading through different games' rulesets, you can instantly tell by their format and terminology if they were designed to be a comprehensive system or a just descriptions of different things the author envisioned. 40k reads like someone explaining the game to a friend, not a set of comprehensive rules you can make a complete system from.  It's not the minor interactions that come from having so many rules, it's the way they are written.

The reason people oppose abortion is not because God said it is bad.  Therefore, the criticism against the opposition to abortion is itself based on something imaginary - a belief either no one or practically no one has.

fd7d7e9dfdbb8e2aa9755c8999caadee,fd7d7e9dfdbb8e2aa9755c8999caadee,"&gt;In The Communist Manifesto, Marx predicted imminent revolution in Europe.
http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/marx-publishes-manifesto
He also predicted it in advanced countries. Not only has this not happened, over 100 years later, but when attempted it was in backwards feudal countries. The attempts resulted in class based authoritarian command economies that failed.
The Manifesto summarised their analysis: the big battles between the feudal order and the bourgeoisie were imminent

1848 was a year of revolutions in Europe.
In 1871 the Paris commune was founded.
The russian revolution started in Russia's industrial centers, Moscow and St Petersburg, and this is where Bolshevicks had support. In the country side other socialists were far more popular.
At the same time there is an uprising or riots or whatever in Germany that is put down by SPD, at the time an officialy marxist party.

Marxism never really caught on in the anglosaxon world (there were cases when socialists would get up to 5 or 6% of the vote followed by ""Red Scares"", see Eugene Debbs or read the Grapes of Wrath for a closer look at that era) and it then got mixed with the anti-colonial movement that flourished in many less developed countries with economies based on agriculture.

You're saying that his post is wrong and is dismantled by switching to an opt-in system. However, the solutions to the questions that he asked have nothing to do with an opt-in system. In fact, they have to do with a system which actively compels everyone else to pick up the tab. 

&gt;This is a very poor argument. Someone who is sterilized may not want to pay taxes that give subsidies for families (someone else's child), yet they are forced to.

That's my point. You're arguing that forcing someone to pay for the child is wrong in one circumstance, but totally fine in another. The sterilized person hasn't opted-in to paying for the child, so, as per your framework, they shouldn't be forced to pay it.",changemyview,t5_2w2s8,3.0,

TLDR: by going 1 mph slower than I suaully drive 11 hours a day I lose $250 per month. 

We don't do it because we're trying to save fuel. It's to get ahead of the driver plain and simple. 
The typical argument I hear on Reddit is how we should just stay in the lane so people in cars don't get held up from us passing. 
First off, fuck anyone who says that. It's fucking selfish. 
If I'm going 65mph on flat ground and another driver is going 64mph I'm going to go around him because I want to keep going 65 and not 64 just because people driving a car can't wait a minute while I pass someone. 
If the guy I'm passing does 64mph 11 hours a day he will do 704 miles. If he does that 5 days a week for a whole year that's 183,000+ miles per year that he's doing. 
Now I come along doing 65mph. Which using the same math I cover 2,000 more miles a year than him. 

On a typical day with my current outfit I make about $250 per day doing about 350 miles. So since I'm covering 11 more miles than him a day but I get stuck behind him doing 64 that means I'm losing $250 per month. 
Now he doesn't directly cause this loss of income because he's just trucking along minding his own business. But I'm losing money by going slower because I get less loads done per year going slower than I usually go. 
So regardless if someone is approaching I'll swing around him, get back up to speed, pass him and then move back over. And then you can go by no problem. 
Additionally, I don't want to stare at the back of a trailer I know I can pass. Anyone can agree with that. 

If you made it this far then that's good. Haha

A Truck driver is on the road for weeks at a time. We deal with every kind of driver. Some are kind and considerate. Some are giant dicks almost accidents. Most are inconsiderate pricks who think that their time is more precious than mine.

He pulls you over for rolling a stop sign. You guys discuss it normally and he mentions that there is drug trafficking in your area and he would like to search your vehicle for drugs. Wells that's all good and great that he's doing his job but you do not have to show him shit without probable cause. A police officer has to have probable cause or a warrant to search your vehicle. You can deny him the ability to search your vehicle without a warrant. 

Let's turn the story. 
A friend calls you and asks for you to bring a cup of sugar with you to a party. You put it in a sandwich baggy and put it in the front seat. Same driving situation. 
He pulls you over. Sees the sugar that looks like an 8-ball and asks you to get out. At this point he has probable cause. Some people scream at them and ask to be released constantly. 
This picture doesn't say to do that. It's merely telling you what your rights are in certain situations and how they pertain to them. Of course every situation is different.

The problem is he still has Ock's personality, which is his weakness. Having ""no fear"" is a SEVERE liability. If you're reading Spider-verse, time shifted SSM just lost to Peter because he's so full of himself, he couldn't even conceive of having lost to Peter in his future that he assumed Peter was from the past. That kind of arrogance leads to failure quickly.

 I can see him getting full of himself on power, and planning on taking on more than he can handle (essentially exactly what happend when he got the symbiote and fought the Avengers) and immediately getting thrashed by someone severely out of his league. Shoot, that's kind of the entire arc of Superior Spider-Man straight through the end of Goblin Nation.

Now hypothetically who would he be strong enough to beat if it weren't for the terrible personality defects? Oh now that is a long list. Considering Peter's body on its own has beaten a herald of Galactus, It would be quite a force within the Marvel U with Extremis.

So you're telling us that homicide, burglary, and rape are that far underreported among whites when compared to blacks? 

You really have no data showing blacks are patrolled more than whites. 

Perhaps you can point to specific departments who stopped blacks disproportionately in stop-and-frisks. But that's entirely different from the police state you make it sound like blacks live under versus a police-less society whites live under. 

&gt;the kid smoking a joint on the corner in a sleepy suburb is committing the same crime, but nobody's there to see or care, so the numbers stay low.

Let's go ahead and move forward with your thesis: let's ignore petty crime, like drug possession, entirely. Look at murder, rape, and burglary—you'll still see much higher numbers for blacks when compared to whites based on their overall population.

50 years since and $20 trillion spent on Great Society programs, and it's still not enough, because poverty isn't something government can ""fix"" with simple wealth transfers. 

Even if we were to accept the ""poverty ==&gt; crime"" thesis (which is nonsense—look at history within the United States or specific ethnic or religious groups), efforts to counter it have made the problem worse.

Welfare and cultural shifts have all but destroyed the black family, where 72% of blacks are born out-of-wedlock and most are raised by one parent. Why chaotic home environments with little guidance and parental support aren't seen as being as much of a contributor to crime as ""poverty"" is dumbfounding. 

It's very often that poor family structure and parenting leads to the very habits which impoverish people: the unwillingness to acquire academic or workplace skills; poor financial management; low impulse control, and so on.

So for example, if you are at the grocery store and you are not sure about a beer, you can scan the label and it will give you a score like 87.8% or 37.6%. which is just their guess at whether or not you will like it. I've played with it a little by scanning beers I know that I already know I like or dislike and and I think it does give make pretty damn good predictions once you've added enough reviews to your profile.

If you rate a beer/wine in their app, it won't tell you, ""If you liked this then you might like Beer X"" the way untappd does. It just stores that score data and uses it develop a profile for your likes and dislikes.




Their biggest shortcoming is that they actually have to have a sample of the beer/wine sent in for analysis to be able to rate it, so their database is lacking all but the more widely available and mainstream beers for the most part. It's still pretty new and growing though, and they claim to be constantly adding more and more to it.

In a situation like this, the workers found property that would be considered mislaid property (as opposed to lost or abandoned property). Mislaid property is property that was put there intentionally by the owner of the property, and the owner for some reason forgets to retrieve it. The charges were dropped because the property at issue (the cash) belongs to whoever placed it there and forgot about it. Since the owner of the house is not the person who placed and forgot it, it is technically not his property (it actually still belongs to the person who placed it there in the first place). Since the owner of the house does not actually own the cash, he cannot be the individual to claim he was deprived of the property (since the property is not technically his).

Saying something and expecting a particular response, in order to test the person, is a bad idea in general and I think it's especially bad if they're INTJ. We're good at picking up on that sort of thing and we don't like it. If we feel like someone's trying to manipulate us, we're likely to shut that person out.

We're direct and we expect other people to be. If you want to know whether he cares, ask, and believe his answer. And be open about your own feelings.

The ""I'm busy"" responses sound to me like an indication that he doesn't care much about you. You're just online friends, you've never met or spoken to each other? It sounds like he doesn't think it's a very close relationship. I don't know if this is common with INTJs but I don't feel very close with people I only know online. If someone online tells a sob story, I'll probably say something sympathetic just to be polite and I feel sorry for them just like I feel sorry for someone I read about in the news who's suffering, but I don't actually care like I would about someone I'm close with. INTJs take a while to warm up to someone, we tend not to have a lot of close friends. It sounds like you're expecting a high degree of emotional connection from someone who might just see you as an acquaintance or casual friend because he doesn't know you well enough yet. It's not a matter of you telling him more about your life, there's no way to force it. If you want to get closer with him then try to have more personal interaction like Skype or visiting.

One thing I'm not sure you touched on, and i assume would during the psychosis scene later, was the relationship between Olive and Caden, and Olive and Adele. You showed eaches reaction to her becoming upset at the idea of having blood, but their relationship itself wasn't talked about (if I'm remembering correctly). It always seemed to me that Adele wanted to push the responsibility of Olive onto Caden, yet when she leaves, she takes Olive with her. Almost as if she's enjoying the fruits of Olive's childhood, but leaving Caden to eat the rest. Further is the idea that Olive is in fact an extension of Caden, Adele can never escape Caden as long as Olive is with her, which to me comes back to the scene where Olive is afraid of the blood inside her. Caden tries to tell her that yes, she has blood (he wants to feel a bit of himself is in Olive), but Adele tells Olive that she doesn't have blood (saying Caden is not in Olive) which allows her to escape from Caden, with Olive, and not feel like, or able to deny, that Caden's work still lingers in the form of Olive.",YMS,t5_2yap0,2.0,

40883e5b7cdd62fb983988bde5c37cc3,40883e5b7cdd62fb983988bde5c37cc3,"I get the feeling you've never done customer support, much less for one in a large call center environment for a faceless corporation.

1.  Comcast likely outsources the support to another company or companies.  Usually companies diversify their support so that differently owned call centers are directly competing with others so they don't get complacent.  They can look at reports and say X call center is doing better than Y, let's give a higher percent of the call volume to X.  How well a call center does as a whole directly impacts job security.  So to say comcast hired the person, it might be true if comcast is the one doing the support, but I'd be pretty skeptical that they do.  Generally, if comcast is outsourcing, they aren't equipped to deal with some random employee of a company they outsource work to in an individual basis.  You don't see the outliers when all the data has been averaged.

2.  Customers call in wanting free stuff all the time.  I mean all the fucking time.  They will have all sorts of creative stories that may or may not be true, claiming previous agents told them they'd get free this or that, usually things that cannot ever be promised.  And even if the customer is telling the truth that an agent told them that, the agent will carefully omit that from their case notes to bring less attention to themselves should the customer call back.  The only way they'd get caught is if the call was randomly picked to get reviewed.  The 2nd agent is only going to have the customer's word vs. the previous agent's notes, which may not confirm what the customer is claiming is accurate.  Now in this case, he has it recorded, but does that truly prove to her that he didn't have a friend record it with him?  At any rate, if she isn't supposed to do it, it's not worth risking her job over satisfying one customer.  In her mind, do you think she cares more about his $12 a month than her own job security?  Absolutely not.

3.  She many not even be capable of offering what he's claiming.  I've had to deal with people who were promised things we cannot do and I couldn't fulfill them either.  And that's not a case of ""well get your supervisor to do it.""  I was the supervisor.  The next level above me was escalated cases and there was a specific guideline for what gets escalated.  A customer supposedly being promised something we literally cannot do was not a valid escalation scenario.  Before you say ""well escalate it anyway and let them handle it"" it doesn't work like that.  Knowingly escalating an invalid case too often gives more back-end work to the team that handles those, which end up de-escalated anyway as invalid.  They don't even get to see the case as the team that approves it would flag it.  Too many invalid escalations can result in a corrective action form (getting written up).  Getting 2 CAFs in 6 months would lead to the agent being terminated.

4.  Within the context of the company I worked for, giving something away for free was called empowerment.  It was doing something outside the normal policy to keep the customer happy and we had limited scope of what we could use it for.  This generally required approval (as a supervisor I didn't need external approval) and was tracked as a percentage of how many calls where you gave away empowerment.  The goal was to not exceed 3% per month and anything over 5% would get investigated into.  So if I legitimately had 20 calls where 2 people had a valid reason for receiving compensation from us for an issue that is on our end, it would've been in my best interest to only give it to 1, and in most cases that tends to be the first person not the second one.

5. Playing back the previous recording was likely a bad choice on his part.  That will flag the new agent that he's likely recording her call as well, and she's going to do everything by the books.  She can't get in trouble for denying him the 12 month promotion if that's what her documents/policies tell her to do.

You try to boil it down to ""well comcast is obligated to follow through with it"" but it's never that simple.  The more likely outcome is the agent that handled the first call will get written up or fired.  And now that it's gone viral to a degree, comcast may try to make it right.  For the average customer though, their call isn't going to go viral, and there are too many degrees of separation to get approval to make it right (or you have no proof the customer is telling the truth, so you err on the side of caution by denying them).  There are just so many factors at play here that someone who hasn't done customer support will be completely oblivious to.",technology,t5_2qh16,1.0,

If they played the event out just as before, but with a minimum Steam Level to trade the relevant items (low enough to be widely accessible, high enough that you have to have had Steam for at least a little while), I think it would nip those issues in the bud.

Jake awoke to the rumbling sound of helicopters flying low over his house. Sitting up slightly and squinting through the haze of sleep, he looked at the clock on his nightstand. Instead of the glowing red numbers, there was only darkness. Then he checked his watch.

3:54 AM.
 
With a sigh he dropped back onto his pillow causing his wife to stir and mutter something unintelligible. Just then a searchlight swept across his yard illuminating his bedroom windows before moving on.

“Fucking Mondays.” He said aloud. Beside him his wife continued to sleep soundly despite the continuing noise. He rolled over and put an arm around her, smiling as he snuggled close to her warmth, envying her ability to sleep through anything. 

Then, over the drone of rotor blades, an announcement sounded in an amplified voice. “A state of emergency has been declared by the United States government. Power and electronic communications networks are down. For your safety, everyone is ordered to exit your homes, remain on your front lawn and await further orders.” The message began to repeat.
What? He thought, utterly confused. Everyone has to go outside? What’s going on? Begrudgingly he arose and walked to the window as a spotlight swept his house again. Down the street he could see several military vehicles as well as a few patrol cars with red and blue lights flashing. Several of his neighbors were already on their lawns looking sleepy and bewildered in their nightclothes. Then he noticed what looked like a greyhound bus being loaded. “What the?”

“What is it honey?” Sue asked having finally awoken and sat up.

“I don’t know. The police and the military are down the street and they are ordering everyone outside. It looks like they are loading people onto a bus.”

“The military? A bus?” She sounded incredulous. Then she heard the announcement amidst the cacophony. 

“A state of emergency has been declared by the United States government. Power and electronic communications networks are down. For your safety, everyone is ordered…” it continued. 

“They’re coming up the street!” Jake said. “They just kicked in Rob Merkele’s door!” His pulse quickened.

“They’re doing what?” Sue asked, still not fully awake.

“They’re dragging his family outside!” 

“Who? The police?”

“The military!” He turned from the window to face Sue. “Fuck this. I don’t know what’s going on but I don’t like it.”

“What are we going to do?” She asked.

He pulled the blinds back again but didn’t answer. The windows were shaking from the helicopters. “They just kicked the Hampton’s door in!”

By now Sue had gotten out of bed and was standing beside Jake looking out of the window.

“Get the kids up and get them in here.” He said.

“Right.” Said Sue and ran from the room and down the hall, turning lights on as she went.

Two more houses and they would be here. What to do? What to do? He thought about hiding places within the house. The attic. The back of a closet. The trunk of their car. Nothing was right. Should he just go along with this?

Sue came back with their two children Tom, 5, and Emily who was 7. They were on their feet but still mostly asleep. 

“Go grab a bunch of their clothes and any medicines they may need. We’ve only got a few minutes. They are almost here.” 

“What to do? What to do?” He kept asking himself aloud. Must he go along with whatever this was? How could they get away? Scanning his memory of the area, he remembered a drainage ditch beyond his property in the back yard that ran into a large tunnel. It was a chance.

Jake ran out of the room to find his wife. “Sue? Sue?”

“Yes?” The sound came from Emily’s room. 

“Sue! Quick, get them dressed as best you can and shoes on their feet, we are going to try to get out by the drainage tunnel behind the house.”

“The drainage tunnel? Is that safe?” She asked.

“It’s our only chance.”

She was still doubtful. “We don’t even know what’s going on. They may shoot us if we run. And if we do get away what then?”

It was obvious how scared she was as she was standing there in her nightgown, bundles of clothes in her arms.

There was a hard knocking at the front door. They both jumped at the sound. “Open up! Open the door!” Pound! Pound! Pound! There were several voices. “Everybody on the street now! Open up. Open the door or we will break it down!” Pound! Pound! Pound!

The look in her eyes as she shook her head no told him all he needed to know. She wouldn’t be running anywhere with the kids. For a moment they just stood there looking at each other in the midst of the chaos. Pound! Pound! Pound!

“Ok.” He said, and walked to open the front door.

There was a large crash as the door busted open. The cops or military men, he couldn’t tell, streamed inside. They were dressed in all black and their weapons were at the ready. 

“Police! Police!” they yelled as they progressed through the house. They came upon his family huddled on the bed in Jake and Sue’s bedroom.  “Everybody on the floor! Everybody down! Get on the floor!”

Jake was in front of his family, his arms spread wide covering as much of them as he could.

“On the fucking ground now!” The point man yelled. His weapon was pointed at Jake’s head where a red dot now bounced and jiggled. “Do it now! Do it now!”

Jakes heart sank. He was powerless. Here were a bunch of armed men threatening his family and all he could do was shield them with his body. Both of their children were sobbing as his wife held them.

“On. The. Fucking. Ground. Now!” The point man shouted. The other men behind him were now coming in and shouting orders and pointing their weapons. The point man grabbed Jake’s wrist and yanked him off of the bed, throwing him to the ground and putting a knee in his back. The second man in grabbed his wife’s wrist pulling her to the ground causing her to scream.

“Hey!” Jake shouted, pulling his head as far off of the ground as he could trying to see. “Stop hurting my wife!” His arm was grabbed, twisted behind his back and a handcuff was snapped around his wrist.

“Stop resisting!” the man on top of Jake yelled.

A third man came into the room, grabbed his daughter and threw her to the floor. She yelled as he did so and began crying loudly.

“Stop you motherfuckers!” Jake yelled. 

The person on top of him put an elbow into his face. “Shut up and stop resisting!” He twisted the other hand around his back preparing to cuff him. Spurred on by the cries of his family and without thinking, he tried to roll over but had no leverage. This prompted another elbow to the face. He tried throw the guy again. This time his left leg found purchase against the nightstand and he pushed. 

Under normal circumstances there would be little chance of anyone bucking a trained fully grown man off of their back, but this was a father protecting his family. A split second of superhuman strength was all that was needed to send him flying against the dresser. Flailing, the cop or whoever grabbed at a partially open drawer as he fell and brought the dresser down on top of himself. Jake, now on his feet, barely avoided the falling dresser as he lunged for the person on top of his wife at the foot of the bed.

He had his knee in the back of her neck and was preparing to cuff her when they made contact. Both went rolling. Jake ended up on the bottom. The man threw several punches and landed a few on Jake’s face, then paused and reached behind himself. Jake took a swing at the man’s face but his fist missed. The free end of the half fastened handcuff did not. It struck the man squarely in the cheekbone, making solid contact enough to break the bone and send blood pouring from his nose and cut onto Jake. That sent the man’s hands to his face as he let out what would have been, if not for the circumstances, a comically effeminate scream. Jake did not notice. All he knew was that the man was no longer trying to fight. Another swing and the handcuffs connected with his temple silencing him.

Jake struggled to his knees, pushing the man off of him and got to his feet. The other person clearing the house, hearing the struggle, now made his way down the hall and into the room. Seeing his one comrade holding his blood covered face and the other struggling to get a dresser off of him, he went into kill mode. He raised his weapon and pulled the trigger as Jake came at him. The sound was instant and sharp, quickly reducing the noise of his kids crying, the helicopters outside, everything, to a high pitched ring.

Jake did not feel the bullet pierce his midsection right below the sternum, was not aware of the .223 round’s tumble as it ripped through flesh and guts, spilling bile and blood where it should not go. Jake was only aware of the man in front of him at as his momentum carried them both to the floor. This time Jake was on top. Rage consumed him. Viciously he punched the man, trying to destroy him, his very existence. Over and over his fist made contact with the man’s face, nose, mouth. Teeth cut his knuckles which began to bleed. Blood splattered everywhere.",WritingPrompts,t5_2s3nb,1.0,

“Jake.” A voice called. “Honey.”

Then he realized he was still beating the man beneath him. His face was no longer recognizable.

He stopped throwing punches and sat gasping. It took a moment for him to recognize his wife. Then he thought of the guy he threw into the dresser and looked over. He was no longer moving. Sensing his question, she answered.

“I hit him with the lamp.” She said.

“The kids! Where are they.” He was on his feet.

“They hid in the closet. They are fine I think. Are you hurt?”

Ignoring her question he said “We have to get everybody out now.” This time there was no hesitation with her. 

She immediately went to the closet and grabbed the five year old picking him up and then took the seven year old’s hand. “Come on baby. Its ok. 

We have to leave ok?” Both were crying but came with her.

Jake led them towards the back door expecting at any moment for someone else to come but no one did. Outside the helicopters were still circling and shining their spotlights on the neighborhood. 

“The trees should hide us until we reach the ditch, then we are going to have to run as quick as we can through the tunnel.”

“Ok.” She said. 

The children stayed close to their mother as they ran across the yard and through the thicket before going down into the ditch. Finally they made the tunnel. It was large enough for an adult to stand up in. A small amount of water ran through the bottom. 

“Go!” He said, starting to feel the pain in his abdomen from the bullet wound.

Different countries often recognize borders and sovereign countries. 

I expect that an atlas sold in Taiwan would be labeled slightly differently from one sold in mainland China for example and the Greeks and Turks might label Cyprus slightly differently. In Russian maps the Crimean peninsula is already included as part of Russia while much of the rest of the world portrays it as still belonging to the Ukraine. Whether or not a map includes Western Sahara probably depends a lot on who draws the borders on it.

Countries don't exist the same way mountains and lakes do. They are not indisputable features of geography, they are social constructs. If you are going to sell your maps in areas where certain countries or borders are not officially recognized it would be a good business decision to conform to the local official definitions rather those followed elsewhere.

What I did to overcome it was, 1.) cut on smoking (like nights only), 2.) eat before you smoke (let the chemistry in your brain calibrate to be hungry while not high). Its gonna be a bit rough to get back there (takes 1-2 weeks w/ tolerance break)

Not that I've heard of, and certainly nothing that was universally applied. While the Inquisition was present across Europe their attitudes and techniques varied drastically based on location. Just about the only universal things were the *protections* that the Inquisition promised to the accused (beyond what the legal system at the time offered) and the format of the tribunal.

I've been pretty clear and transparent.

My investment firm, Atlantic Financial, bought the company Fleetwood Video some years back and changed the name to FDVT or Fleetwood Digital Technology Corp.- I believe 2004 or so but I am not positive -- certainly quite a while back.  A family of a deceased business owner approached me and asked me to buy the business for what seemed to be a cheap rate.  I figured it had enough revenue to cover the purchase cost and some goodwill from being so old (founded in 1985) and the customer list and registration to do business with the government.

The company served the clients mentioned - mainly selling blank video tapes for security cameras.  That's pretty much what the business did.  One of the Atlantic Financial employees had plans to make it into more of a broad consulting company but we didn't.   

The company continued those services for a couple years as the contracts wound down and never worked in those areas again.  We considered pursuing some government business but didn't.  The company never asked for or got any new government contracts and the one part time employee who was on board with the aquisition moved on -- the internal employee working on it moved on.   The small amount of revenue that came in covered most of the costs of the purchase.  

I had thought that the business might have had value since it is a service disabled veteran business and I'm a disabled vet -- but I never used that certification or pursued those lines of business.  It's really not my cup of tea.  I had also considered using the business as a vehicle to help out a freind who is a martial arts trainer who had trained military and police - so he could run contracts through the business since it was registered in all the databases needed to do business with the government but it was too much effort relative to the reward.

We scrapped all the inventory, delisted all contracts with all government agencies and turned the shell of what was left into basically a catch all for web development and domain names we are afflicted with.   The company took on a couple small web consulting clients in later years.

At the time -- 2004 or so, I was not as adamantly against the government as I am now.  I had some interest in some types of government contracts -- I didn't pursue them but some of the work such as USAID efforts in Pakistan and security work interested me.  I didn't pursue it, it doesn't interest me now and I don't do any government work now.   Even the tiny bit of work that this company, which was owned by my company did was not something I was personally active in or profited from.

I am only giving so much information for full disclosure.   That client list is pretty similar for Google, Microsoft, Dell etc Etc.   The government buys a lot of stuff.   I don't like it, I don't prefer working woth government and I wish they were smaller.

Most overseas Chinese girls have been brought up as only childs in their family and are quite rude. I've had my fair amount of bad experiences dating them. It's a culmination of society and parental doting, where an entire family system only has them for the future. Not to mention that most of them have to extremely well off to even come to this beautiful land, so they are quite disjointed from reality.

I work in retail part time and I know many many rich Chinese girls. They tell me that they go on Tinder etc and stuff to find white boys exclusively as it's more cool, even if they have Asian bfs. Generally, you will have a chance with them if you're rich or good looking but I suggest you go to Asia if you really like Asians. In Australia, you're not exactly marketable.

Next, why would the man need to forfeit such a huge amount? If this were enacted the ""fair"" system would require the woman to pay the man damages for not having a child he wanted. It's illogical in concept, not to mention there is no reason for child support to be increased.

Also, some women don't even find out until 8 weeks or more into a pregnancy. This would mean that the man wouldn't have a choice.

Sure they do.

&gt;He contained gravity, that makes any sense to you? Can you explain that to me with logic?

It was virtual. Whatever was creating it created it from x point, and his hand contained the virtual gravity inside his hand because it wasn't real gravity. That said I don't know the context of that feat only that it exists. 

&gt; Magic making something that weights infinity, lighter, makes no sense to me either (in this particular situation), how much is infinity minus a million times a quadrillion tons? Still infinity!

Easy. The pages don't exist in this world, but exist in a different dimension.

&gt;If they had magic that could make the book weight less than infinity, there is no difference from making it weight as much as a planet or a glass of water.

Unless the magic becomes exponentially more costly. 

Think of it like file compression. You can compress a 10 gig file into say 1 gig, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it smaller. They can make magic compress infinite weight into a ""manageable"" weight, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it less weight.

My spring traps have launched more giants than my defenses have killed. The big bomb? Idk... I had extra wall pieces there like next to my cc but WB's haven't been a problem at all. Mass giants or mass archers have been the biggest threat. They drop em to take out that AD knowing they'll also take a crack at that vital ""exposed"" wall piece. After the AD is gone they throw out a healer which my balloons and archers dispose of.

* is faster than stock/early roms
* works with the keyboard dock
* doesnt have charging problems
* doesnt have battery drain issues
* still in some state of development so that bugs might have a chance of being fixed

* zombi-x: http://forum.xda-developers.com/transformer-prime/development/rom-t2920306
* crombi-kk: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2773812

You have a temperature peak around the stœchiometric of the fuel. The peak begins before lambda and ends after lambda. The danger here is that running a tad bit leaner than lambda will increase combustion temperature. If you continue to lean, there will not be enough fuel to produce heat thus the peak goes down. 

What I am saying is that it is difficult without proper engine monitoring to determine if you are passed the heat peak or not. CHT temp is critical IMHO. because the head gets less oil and is only cooled by air, the only other way to keep it cool is to run richer. The unburnt fuel will drop the combustion temperature at the cost of producing more undesirable by-byproduct. 

The only fuel that I know that will burn hotter when richer is the Diesel and alike (jet fuel and such). They are totally different than 100LL. ",flying,t5_2qm1t,1.0,

Not entirely sure what youre asking so this might not be the answer youre looking for: Essentially it is just a coincidence, A858 has various timezones it uses, one of those happens to fall in line with Massachusetts. The important factor is its controlled by the bot itself and likely has absolutely no relation to where the bot is located in real life.

&gt; how the reason why nothing has been solved yet is because there is nothing to solve

Plenty of things have been solved, take a look at this list: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/wiki/posts

Some of them are not yet completely solved however eventually they will be. It is clear that the owner of the bot is aware that we are solving these codes and are specifically putting out puzzles - hence why theres no way its used to test reddit. 

If youre wondering why the bulk of it isnt being solved is because its not yet possible. There are clues in the easier puzzels which give information on how to solve the main bulk. The working theory is those messsages you see being posted constantly are actually part of groups and are more than likely encrypted. There is no way of outright breaking the encryption (or incredibly low chance) so we rely on solving the other puzzels to even be able to think about trying to solve those. 

&gt;there might just be a certain pattern to the random strings generated (e.g on letters a-f are included)?

The pattern you are seeing is HEX encoding. Essentially hex is any 0-9 A-F (Where A = 10 and F = 16).  Hex is a way of displaying non-text(non ASCII) data in a human readable format.

This is the response to the asset declining significantly in value, not necessarily the same thing as ""rates rising"".  There is also no guarantee a firm will pay its obligations on the debt (especially on jr unsecured or other lower priority tranches). In the event of catastrophic failure of a credit portfolio, the hedge fund can declare bankruptcy, wipe their hands clean, and owe us nothing beyond the liquidation value of the fund (and at 5x leverage, ""catastrophic"", where we could potentially incur a loss, would be a 20% hit in equity of the portfolio). Any deficit between that and the margin they posted would be our bank's loss.  Likewise, if they were to walk away from a negative margin equity portfolio, it could potentially take days (or weeks) to liquidate positions of a hedge funds size.  During this time, the liquidation could accelerate the market to move against the assets thus forcing greater losses on the bank.

This is why liquidity considerations are part of the margining methodology. In stocks we look at multiples of 100x avg daily trade volume. With credit we're concerned with % of outstanding issuance as well as # of available executable pricing sources (from appropriately sized dealers) and frequency of those broker quotes. 

This generalizes your question though. Credit portfolios don't inherently suffer when rates rise. There are plenty of floored and variable coupon and step coupon corp bonds out there that are intrinsically lower duration. ",investing,t5_2qhhq,3.0,

It's to stop people who can't afford to consume the legal vodka from purchasing illicit supplies.

The government in the past decade has been increasing taxes on it and implementing stricter rules. It's reduced consumption and deaths by a third so far. However the downside to this is that illicit vodka is becoming more common for those who can't afford the prices.

This has been a problem for some time now.

http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2013/07/17/russias-vodka-tax-backfiring/
&gt; As many experts – and drinkers – warned from the start, high taxes on alcohol have driven hard-drinking Russians to seek out cheaper, illegal sources of booze. Vodka makers complain that they can no longer compete with a thriving black market offering cut price liquor and moonshine.

http://english.pravda.ru/business/companies/21-11-2012/122882-vodka-0/
&gt; According to official figures, the volume of vodka sold on the Russian market doubles the amount of produced vodka. In 2011, the statistical difference was 40 percent. Factory counterfeit products, produced in the ""fourth shift"", are available in all cities of Russia and take about one-third of the market - one billion bottles.


It's right for the government to take action on Vodka consumption and illicit production. Russia has sorted it's self out from being the demographic basketcase it was, however there are still to many Russians dying unnecessarily. Unless they can stop police and officials from turning a blind eye on the illicit production, raising taxes won't do much. 

They need to take a more long term approach. The way the UK does when it comes to stopping drinking and driving and smoking. Hard hitting ads, NGOs and youth groups that spread awareness, large alcohol free zones that makes drinking inconvenient and etc.

At this point it's a societal issue and not something that can be solved by higher taxes.",europe,t5_2qh4j,6.0,

1) don't smoke pot until you've passed the test. (Duh)

2) Work out. With a focus on cardio. This helps burn fat that thc could be stored in. I don't know if it actually will make much of a difference however doing cardio was never a bad thing anyway.

You could steal my phone and still have zero access. 

Also,  it's easy to buy, the fees are low and its old school.  It's one of the oldest plus it's located just a few miles from me so I like that as well.  

For your pocket money, 1,000 dollars or less Coinbase is great. Instant buy once your verified and dollar wallet if you want to get out of the volitility on occasion.

For more than 1,000 buy a mycelium thumb drive paper wallet generator and use paper wallets for any big money. 

Or check out Coinbase ""vault"" where you can set up super security on larger amounts of coins. 

It's easy, and dummy proof.  

I've tried them all and this is just plain the easiest, and most dummy proof way to get it done.

F2P MMOs with cash shops make really inconsistent money, as some months people will drop $100+ in a cash shop, while they may not spend any more money in a cash shop for the next year or two after that. That inconsistency usually leads to cash shop based MMOs having lower man-power for creating new content, and they usually work on content that is faster to create/put out, as they can't get involved with long projects if they can't assure that they can cover the costs through in-game shop purchases alone.

In the comics, Daisy, Black Widow and Fury are the only agents with level 10 clearance, or something to that affect. Daisy is *fiercely* loyal to Shield, so we know she would never betray the good guys, and that's all good and great! I have a feeling on the other hand, this subreddit is trying to hard to introduce Ward as the epitome of evil in the show. And for Ward to be so blinded by an obsession that he thinks is true love could make him the true threat of a season or two is too easy for the writers, not to mention in my mind, is somewhat unrealistic. If Wards thinks his true feelings of love for Skye are real, then all those moments where we see him improve when Skye is around and redeem himself do not point in the direction of someone descending into a fit of madness and the desire to murder. It makes Wards character childish, and I don't believe that's what Ward really is. Personally, I think that now that Skye has shot Ward, and proven that his endeavours to win back Skye are fruitless, he will simply leave from her life in silence. Over the rest of the season, with Agent 33 by his side, I think he will be realistic with himself and try to rid her from his mind as best he can, though that's not to say I think we will succeed. I believe he will always have feelings for skye, but he will just be able to control and understand them better.

Note TPS takes place BETWEEN 1 and 2, meaning that TPS happened after the events of Knox. The story with Athena tied up about to get shot, which takes place after BL2. Lillith is angry at Athena for supporting Jack, causing the death of many, many people (Roland cough cough) but this kind of does not explain the plot hole with claptrap. If he is the one we play in TPS how come Lilith doesnt shut him down or kill him because he ""supported jack"" but whatever, the other two characters staying with Jack does support the story.

Edit. Made a mistake on the name of RAD.

CMUs current endowment is like 1.9bn. More than the tax has brought in since its inception.


The group that funds the stadium authority, the group that uses our taxes to build hundred million dollar staduims for the Rooneys and the like also have received an obscene amount of money so they wouldn't have to pay out of pocket or get loans for there own stuff.

Things have changed, and since the late 80's the emphasis has been on shrinking government, and reducing taxes on business and capital.  These are the ideas associated with Reganonmics, and neo-liberalism, and that underpin the current CPC.

However,  judges, unless complete idiots,  would never grant custody, even partial,  to a rapist.   Many states do have specific laws revoking custody from rapists.  However I'm pretty sure those require a conviction.   Though frankly, as the law sits,  they're not a rapist if not found guilty.   

The problems with custody and child support involving ""rape"" where the offender is granted parental rights of support or custody,  isn't actual rape but statutory rape,  these cases are under a slightly different color of law,  as the offender and victim are not necessarily risk laden when it comes to the welfare of the child.  Even though if convicted they'd likely dissolve any parental rights anyhow.   Ultimately this particular matter isn't one of regular concern,  or even of minor concern.   At very worst,  the rape victim will have to fight the custody in court, which can be a pain in the ass,  plus a traumatic bit considering their rapist is the plaintiff.   But to be actually awarded custody for their efforts,  I'm not sure a case as such even exists in the US (statutory rape excluded) and if it does, it's exceedingly rare.  ",changemyview,t5_2w2s8,5.0,

This probably won't answer your question in regards to ""whats best"" but it really is a personal choice.

0f49ad90bcbde1b7ea17ec420c435752,0f49ad90bcbde1b7ea17ec420c435752,"&gt;Do you believe that social equity is particularly lacking in video games, as opposed to other forms of media and/or art? If so, in what ways?

I think that video games as a whole, when you count mobile and indie games, is incredibly diverse. The areas where they are lacking are generally those with large budgets since developers tend appeal to the largest groups. It's not really any different from television and movies in that respect. The main difference is that the demographics in video games are much more young/male than movies so the video games which get made will reflect that.

&gt;Do you believe that video games are a medium via which social values should be progressed? If so, how so? If not, why not?

Yes. I definitely think games can carry and deliver social values. And not only that, these games already exist. Many tend to be critiques of video games and video game culture rather than society at large. (See [AVGM](http://edmundmcmillen.blogspot.com/2009/02/avgm-retrospective.html), [Cow Clicker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_Clicker), [Spec Ops: The Line](http://www.polygon.com/2012/11/14/3590430/dont-be-a-hero-the-full-story-behind-spec-ops-the-line), etc). As more people get on board with the idea and start buying such games more such games will be made.

&gt; What is your opinion of the presence of social equity in video games over the lifetime of video gaming? Have things gotten better or worse, and what games or characters make you feel this?

The stories have gotten better and the characters are more interesting than before. The capacity for games to create and express such stories has grown because platform(s) that allow for distribution have grown large enough to have an audience for these games and the technology out there allows for developers to focus more on fleshing out the game rather than debugging code.",AgainstGamerGate,t5_3441a,2.0,

Sure, cops perform sobriety tests, but those are so subjective that it would be difficult to use them as the sole basis of an intox arrest - this is why we have an objective BAC measurement; numbers dont lie.

Judgement call in the field, with an arrest and blood test if the officer feels there is impairment. Then let a jury decide.

I understand the siren song of removing individual judgement from the process, but it causes a lot of collateral damage.

You seem to think that men have this idea that femininity is bad, but I see it more as femininity implies lack of masculinity, which is bad (for men). Society still has an idea of what is masculine and what is feminine and it likes its men and women to conform to those.  

I'm sure you wouldn't want to be told that you have a manly voice or that you are very hairy, but these are things that a man would probably like for himself. If I said you had a manly face, I'm guessing you wouldn't be too pleased (maybe you would, I don't know you) but if someone told me that, I'd be giddy. The phrase ""you throw like a girl"" is misleading (at least as far as I interpret it). On the surface it seems like it means that girls cannot throw, but it is more akin to ""you don't throw like a boy.""  
  

I don't know that I can answer the last part. Personally, I don't see why women doing things makes them no longer manly, but I'll do my best to explain what I think it is.  

As far as I can tell, it is something to do with it no longer being masculine. If anyone can do it, how is it masculine? So when a man wants to assert his masculinity, he has to look for something else. The more women start doing traditional men things, the harder it is to find something manly.  

It's all very silly, but things like this always are. I try to avoid those mindsets but none of us are immune from it. We're all just trying to find our way in a world filled with people telling us how to do it.",AskWomen,t5_2rxrw,4.0,

I mean, socialisation comes into it - people tell us that we have to be manly and mock us if we're not. Men end up looking for ways to define and assert this manliness. Just look at how many movies there are about becoming a man (Mulan doesn't count).  

However, since manliness is mostly a social construct and the gender divide is reducing rapidly, it's hard to see what it is to be a man. As more and more women start doing the things that used to define men, men don't know how to be a man.  

Luckily, with age most of them develop a more internal idea of manhood and don't feel such a massive and constant need to prove their masculinity.",AskWomen,t5_2rxrw,3.0,

And a lot of them were literally preyed upon by multi-billion dollar companies with legions of lawyers.  It's not as much of an excuse as it is a ruing of what we the people have allowed to happen to our kids.

I have a friend that went to school in the late 80ies and he was told by his school aid counselors that he had no access to work study or grants and had to take loans to finish his degree.  He was clueless what the consequences were as he'd never even had a credit card to that point.

As it turned out, the very counselors tasked with helping him were found to have taken kick back by the loan corporations and they lied to him about the grants.  He should have been given approximately 85% grants and would be facing a fraction of the debt he ended up with.

This is what we are doing to our kids, opening up the door to literal financial predators.  Our kids, our children.

Any rights NOT specifically listed here belong to the states or the people"". So what's to stop a state from limiting (for example) my freedom of religion?

So while it wasn't his fault that we had a lot of injuries it was his fault that we didn't adjust our scheme to try and cover up those injuries.

Congrats on your tv, looks nice. According to http://www.lg.com/ca_en/tvs/lg-42LH40-lcd-tv you have two possible outputs: the headphone jack and optical digital (spdif). Your speaker jacks are as follows.


Color | Channel
---|---
Green | Front l and r
Orange | sub and center
Black | Surround l and r
  

1- the easy solution (cheap and fast)

**Headphone jack**, and that will plug into the **lime green** connector, that will allow you to use your 2 satelites. Probably you could get the sub and center to work via some mode on the speakers where center is the average of the two and sub is the low frequency sum of the two signals.

2- Harder solution, but better:

You may find a toslink to 3.5 mm converter like this [Converter](https://sewelldirect.com/Sewell-51-DTSDolby-Digital-to-Analog-Converter-35mm-Output.asp)

Connect it to the optical out in the back of your LCD and then enjoy. It'll set you back 65$ though.",hometheater,t5_2rof6,1.0,

That could be the explanation, so it must be the explanation? Does that really work? Imagine if someone proposed this for any other experience billions of people had. ""They could all be hallucinating when they saw that solar eclipse. People do hallucinate after all."" Moreover, this argument never goes away no matter what happens. Even if Jesus shows up tomorrow and God projects his voice across the Earth in all languages and everyone remembers it, it's still technically possible that we all hallucinated. That's absolutely not a reason for us to think that's true though. If we disregard experiences just because we don't agree with their implications or findings, we're almost guaranteed to be wrong about something.

&gt;If there were modern polytheists, they could just do what modern christian apologists do and change their arguments, discarding ancient ones that we've shown false -- like most christians do with a lot of the old testament.

So you actually weld the same area sometimes 4-5 times buttering the base metal til you get good fusion and good metal. Then as you buildup some of the crud floating on the top of your previous bead will cause problems on the next bead, so you float it up to brush/grind it off.

So, in other words, ignoring your primary argument, which you have been continuing to argue in this thread despite the lack of evidence supporting it (IMO).

Whether or not the name fits the purpose is a matter of opinion. I can't fault you your opinion, and I see where you're coming from, but IMO an equally primary attribute of the Bulldog according to its description is its stoutness and durability, which the name reflects quite well.

There already being a weapon named the Bulldog is a legitimate point, which makes me wonder why it's not much more than an afterthought in the OP. That said, it's not as if it's not something that happens in real life (for example: [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Bulldog), [2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_Arms_Bulldog)).

I would love for there to be a heaven, and in mine it will be full of my old dogs and a few cats too. Sadly heaven is a religious construct and allows nutters to suicide bomb with the promise of 72 virgins, including young boys.

Oh, and definitely no dogs for that particular religion are allowed in heaven.

Do you still live with them? If not then stand up, tell them in a sentence or two that you have already explained yourself and refuse to do so over and over, and that the decision has been made. 

If they persist? Leave. Walk out of the house and go back home. Ignore any anger they might send in text messages, and don't answer phone calls from them. Then, put in an email the reasons why their pushing upsets you. Reiterate in the email that you refuse to engage in the conversation again if they bring it up, and you will simply leave again.

After that, steel yourself. They'll kick off and accuse you of disrespect and childishness for not having the conversation. Weather it and don't respond. They'll run out of steam with no response.

You can definitely find live music just about every night of the week in Denver- a lot of it for free, and some of it quite good. Westword is my go to for finding free live music.

Capitol Hill and Cheesman Park are the most popular areas for people in their 20s. I never really considered these areas because of how inconvenient they are for public transportation. I'd suggest looking at apartments near light rail stations- specifically the 10th and Osage station, Broadway Station, University of Denver station, and Colorado Station. Try the location based search on padmapper.com. 

There are new apartments popping up all over the place. I live within a 5 minute walk from a light rail station and I pay less then 800 a month in rent for a fairly large 1 bedroom apartment. I regularly take the light rail when I'm going out for drinks- south Broadway is one of my favorite areas and it's an easy 10 minute walk from the Alameda station. The Santa Fe Art district is about a 5 minute walk from the 10th &amp; Osage station and has an awesome First Fridays event with free admission to all of the museums.

It came into existence here on the internet, and those screenshots include endorsed contributers. Make all the excuses you want, what the redpill is actually about is very very obvious.

The redpill is an excuse to shift the blame for romantic failures from the redpillers to the women they failed to attract, by turning women into the enemy. It tells boys that it's not *their* fault, it's the fault of the woman who are inherently out to get men and who only care about their status and the contents of their wallets. Then it feeds them a bunch of lies and pseudoscience and rehashed conservative values (women cheat! women want older men! women won't respect you! women are only valuable while young and naive!) while totally failing to tell them what healthy relationships are like. 

Even the core idea is a cognitive dissonance: Women occupy all of their mental real estate and they twist and contort themselves to get their attention, engaging in elaborate plots and acting out scripts and making pretty much their entire life about ""bettering"" themselves so that women will want them. Then they claim that they have found a revelation about how not to be controlled by women. Yeah right. Making yourself into a guard doesn't get you out of jail, it just makes you the slave of the inmates because now everything you do is about keeping them in. 

It's a toxic outlook that dooms anyone who follows it to a lonely future of hostile and antagonistic relationships while causing massive amounts of incidental harm to the women they date and any children unfortunate enough to be born to them. 

It doesn't even work to pick up women. Anyone who approaches lots of women will eventually find one who is willing to stick around. Fools attribute their ""success"" to the redpill when really it's just that even horrible people with no redeeming qualities can get a SO. The world is full of examples, which they ignore. And when they do get into a relationship, it's generally with someone horrible, because they are looking for the stupid superficial things the redpill told them to look for, and ignoring red flags left right and center. Self fulfilling prophecy - if you expect women to be evil and materialistic and manipulative you don't blink when you find one that acts that way - and she *will* date you because she's used to men running for the hills when they figure out what she is. 

So yeah, have fun defending the redpill. Be another sucker who falls for something cooked up by people who hate women as an excuse to hate women more, and let them keep ruining your life. Bye.

I would thus encourage you to try more Elomi bras. Fauve in 36GG too if you can get your hands on them. Fantasie is made for a more even shape, Freya will most likely be too narrow and demand more volume on top than you currently have. 

Bravissimo also has that rounded bottom in the majority of their bras, thus my recommendation for them. 

As for Cleos - try them in your correct size or it will be difficult to judge fit. In a too wide band it is hard to swoop and scoop correctly. 

You could probably get Cleo Lucy to fit you if you tried it in 34H/HH and altered the gore. It is possible to sew the gore narrower and in many cases this changes the fit of the Lucy from ""horrible"" to ""best bra ever"".

Additionally your breasts will change over the next year or so. They will become more even and you will need less volume in the bottom and more volume on top.

I'm also in college and I am lucky enough to have a job that pays me enough to get to and from tournaments and also compete in them. I own a Modern deck that I am quite good at playing so I don't have to worry about that and I recently used the money from placing at the SCG Worcester Premier IQ to purchase the GB Constellation shell and the Jeskai shell so I can play either of those in standard or sell them off to play a different deck. 

Im very lucky to be in a situation where I can do this but there are still budgetary limits and im not above trying to bum a hotel room floor or sleeping in the car but I haven't had to do that yet. I don't splurge on material goods, I don't eat out, I don't spend money on things that aren't Magic unless I need to do something like car repair. 

Competitive Magic needs to be a big priority I think if you want to do it. I still value my personal life and my girlfriend as well as my school work over Magic but at this point in my life I'm lucky enough to not have to worry about paying bills and maintaining a home or anything like that thanks to dorm life. I'm sure things will change in the future but right now I'm young and I want to travel and I want to play Magic most of all. ",spikes,t5_2utkz,1.0,

I guess I was under the misconception that knighthood was originally awarded for chivalric purposes such as bravery in battle and that kind of thing, which made it even more confusing for me to see how it's so often been given to celebrities lately. This thread has helped me understand the difference. However, I feel that maybe they're given out too easily lately? But I can see why people such as Sir Elton John are given a knighthood, for his lifelong, inspiring work in music.

Does it happen often that when a new monarch ascends to the throne that knighthoods are taken away if say, the new monarch does not agree with or like some people previously knighted?

Remember, when this is all said and done you want to make sure that everything is documented. Every lie the media told, every inaccuracy that was peddled as ""truth"", every misappropriated label and narrative paradigm that they pushed onto the public -- it all needs to be documented. 

A lot of this is for red-pilling neutrals. If they go to Google and type in ""GamerGate right-wing"", they'll get slapped in the face with the truth.

259fdf15cec30ddf8388aef959e1fcfe,259fdf15cec30ddf8388aef959e1fcfe," 1. Why did you choose Android or iOS? 

Back in 2010, when I was looking to upgrade from my Blackberry, I wanted a smartphone, but iPhone was only on AT&amp;T, a carrier with which I had had horrible experiences with.    But Verizon was showing off this neat ""Droid"" Incredible phone.   I got it, it worked great, from what I could see, it was as good as an iPhone with few gaps.   It even had built-in voice turn-by-turn navigation, something that iOS wouldn't have for years.  

Since then, I've just continued to use Android mostly because I *really* use all the Android features, things like NFC, Google Wallet, automation with Tasker, swipe typing, etc. so going to iOS would always seem like a downgrade.   I simply am not willing to lose function I've come to depend upon.    I will say that iOS has done a good job in catching up, particularly with iOS 8,  but there are still things that are lacking.  

I'll also caveat this by saying that I do use an iPad for work and I do think that iOS has done tablets pretty well, better than Android mostly because I don't tend to use all those advanced functions when using a tablet.     But the first thing I did on the iPad was to sweep all the Apple stuff into a folder and populate my home screen with Google stuff instead.   I'm deeply invested in the Googleverse, so having Google be a first class player on any device is important to me. 

       2. What are some things you envy about the opposite platform?

I like the way that iMessage works smoothly.   I'd really like for Hangouts to get to that level.   I'd also like for Google Music to offer the breadth of music you can find on iTunes.   Also, as I said before, I'd like for Android's tablets to be better.   I think they came very close with the Nexus 7.   I like mine (a 2012 3G model that so far is still waiting for Lollipop).   But it is sluggish now.   Very different from my iPad.    Finally, I'd like Google to enforce a little more uniformity in its hardware so that we can see a better 3rd party market for things like mounts, cases, etc.  


       3. What can you do on your platform that is easier or does not exist on the opposite platform?

Google Now voice integration and Moto X's features like the wave to see notifications/time and hands free ""OK Moto"" search are great.   So is 4K video capture.    But I still go back to the basics:   Google's intents system is so advanced compared to iOS' nascient extensions.    To see what I mean, use Google Now to say ""Play music by Trans Siberian Orchestra"".    When Google responds, you can just let it play with the default player (Google Music on my phone) *or* you can choose *another* music player that's on your phone, like tuneIn radio,  Amazon Music, Spotify, Pandora, etc.   You simply cannot do that on iOS and it drives me crazy, especially since I generally use cloud-based music all the time, either Spotify or Google Music.   So if I tell  ""Play Trans Siberian Orchestra""  to Siri, it whines about the fact that I don't have their music on my device instead of maybe bringing up Spotify.  

That plus automation.   I love that you can use things like Tasker to do crazy things like push programmable actions from your phone to Chromecast or automate certain settings based on time of day, location, or wifi network name.

The immediate effects on my clarity, focus, and mental energy were moderate, but noticeable, very similar to taking a blood-brain barrier crossing choline supplement like Alpha-GPC. This is due to the tams (and noopept) doing basically the same thing as a choline supplement (increasing choline in your brain), just in a different way; dosing choline will give it to you semi-immediately, after it is absorbed into your blood and passes the b-b barrier, while the tams increase your natural choline production temporarily. There are, of course, many differences in brain chemistry between people (namely their cholinergic systems), with different rate-limiters and impacts based on presence of other chemicals. Whenever I test a new chemical, I look for the following things in order:

1) Research indicating long term positive effects. Because it's extremely difficult to self-measures over long periods, this is really your only option.

2) Test a small dosage at the lower range and look for any immediate effects, positive or negative. Note all of them.

3) Continuing testing with increasing dosages if test 2 was, at the very least, not negative. Continue doing so until a reasonable upper limit on intake is reached (based on research and your own experience with similar chemicals). If there's any negative effects, evaluate if using the substance is worth having that side effect.

If there's no research to indicate long term effects and no immediate benefit at upper intake levels, it's probably a dud for you and you should move onto better things, and not waste your money. If there's an immediate positive effect, take it as long as you feel safe and have the money to do so. If there's a long term positive benefit but no immediate effect, weigh the long term effect against the long term effects of other potential nootropics you can purchase with the same money, and purchase as many long term supplements as your budget will allow.

He was the worst thing about the Frozen season IMO, even though I don't hate him in the movie and the actor did a great job.

I just don't want it to turn into a long running story where Hans just keeps coming back to try to take Arendelle over and over again.  It would get really old, cause they have to go out of their way to make him a believable threat to Elsa, especially if she finally gets some guards who aren't morons/know who they're supposed to be taking orders from so that they don't side with Hans every time he comes in and declares himself king.

&gt; yet the OUAT fandom liked more Elsa, deeming that Anna was too goofy at times.

I didn't get that at all.  I thought Elizabeth Lail's Anna was pretty universally liked, even among OUaT fans who generally hated the Frozen arc.

&gt; Perhaps, In the end I just hope they don't drown us on this kind of stuff, more Frozen is good but becoming like the SW AU that no one but the most hardcore could follow due the extensive material there was would be overwhelming.

I could see it turning into that if none of the books are canon and Frozen 2 contradicts them, cause we already have the Frozen arc on OUaT which isn't canon.  The thing with the Star Wars EU is that there are a ton of books, video games, etc, almost none of which are canon and they frequently contradict each other, so there are just a ton of alternate universes there.",Frozen,t5_2vpth,2.0,

Root actually said something to the effect that she's bored and disappointed in people and wants to set the Machine free in her first (or maybe second) episode as Root. And I believed her. But that didn't mean she wasn't a danger to the team.

I'm surprised though that it's annoying/disturbing for some people (I've seen some comments like that before too) that Root calls the Machine “she”. My take is that it would be strange if Root called the Machine “it”. I would guess that people who are annoyed by the “she” maybe don't like Root's character that much in the first place, because calling the Machine “she” is very much in line with Root's development and motivations. 

Root has allowed herself to be molded (and in some ways healed) by the Machine and she has made it obvious that not only is she willing to die for the Machine but she pretty much experts that that'll happen, Root has insisted the Machine cares etc. So if Root would call the Machine an “it” that would be like saying Root would knowingly revise her principles and sacrifice herself for a can of chicken soup and the chicken soup would appreciate it. People might compromise or risk whatever for gold or food etc, but then it's about greed or survival and that's not the deal with Root and the Machine.",PersonOfInterest,t5_2sd8v,1.0,

&gt;Geography has made us neighbors. History has made us friends. Economics has made us partners. And necessity has made us allies. Those whom nature hath so joined together, let no man put asunder.

&gt;What unites us is far greater than what divides us. The issues and irritants that inevitably affect all neighbors are small deed in comparison with the issues that we face together--above all the somber threat now posed to the whole neighborhood of this continent--in fact, to the whole community of nations. But our alliance is born, not of fear, but of hope. It is an alliance that advances what we are for, as well as opposes what we are against.

Not really, most people who game want a desktop since laptops are just awful for playing games on. That and there are very few bare bone laptop chassis than an end user can purchase. 

To game on a laptop you will need to spend at least $1200 to get about 1/2 the performance of a $600 PC. Gaming laptops are also very heavy, use a ton of power (don't try to use it unplugged...), generate a ton of heat and are much more likely to break. 

If he really wants to play on max settings a desktop is going to be a must unless he has a $3000 budget for a top-of-the-line laptop.

*edit* 

Also gaming laptops are non-upgradeable, you spend $1200 on something that will be too slow inside 2 years anyway. If he wants to game get a good desktop and a weaker laptop for portable needs. Gaming laptops just are not worth the money you pay for them.",buildapc,t5_2rnve,1.0,

Using sed, with 's' will evaluate the string you pipe it into and substitute the value in order.  So, in my very simple solution sed 's/,//2' is going to evaluate all commas, and substitute nothing for them, in the second instance.   Now, had my command been this:

    echo $string | sed 's/,//g'

That would have substituted all commas globally in the entire string.  However, we only wanted to strip out the second one.   If we wanted to change the second comma to say a colon we could change sed to this syntax:

    echo $string | sed 's/,/:/2'

Also, in sed, the froward slashes are just delimiters (lack of a better word) for the substitution going on, you can replace them with other characters like asterisks in the event you want to substitute slashes like so:

    echo $string | sed 's*,**2'

So, I am assuming that CSV is some sort of inventory sheet for Dell monitors, so assuming all the data you want to edit is in the same format we can assume that the second comma is the one you want replaced.

No, I called one *article* ""schismatic and worthless"" as well as a couple other words.  I didn't do that to this article.

The article from Weigel is neither schismatic nor worthless, and I called it ""a worthwhile read.""  

&gt;He is not a man of tradition at all. An understanding of his papacy will stand on its own outside of the context of dead European popes

I disagree.  There is much of the Church's tradition of concern for social justice issues that Francis has incorporated into his own outlook.  There is also a great deal of the theology of John Paul II and Benedict XVI by Francis' own admission (*Evangeli Gaudium*, sections 7, 112, 123, 198, and 272 for Benedict XVI, and sections 15, 27, 32, 40, and 110 for John Paul II.  You’ll also find a reference to Pius XI in section 205, as well as John XXIII in 41 and 84.  And that’s just the direct references in just one document) .  Of course Francis is new.  So was Benedict XVI.  So was John Paul II.  So was every pontiff before all of them.  But there is no divorce between Francis and ""dead European popes.""  On the issue of social justice, reading Francis without the context of previous papal statements on that subject will lead to an incomplete understanding of Francis.  

I invite everyone to read the social justice encyclicals, then to re-read Francis’ statements, then to judge for themselves.

It probably doesn't make sense from a pure cash outflow analysis now, but for me it goes into greater relationship building that ends up directly affecting my salary. There's something to be said for the social effect alcohol has on building relationships. I have to deal with my boss in a very professional manner 95% of the time I'm around him, but he's good about cutting back and building our relationship personally when he takes us out to bars. This ends up affecting how we interact when we're back at the office. If he generally likes me as a person outside of work, it makes dealing with the things that come up inside work a lot easier, and usually translates into him being more willing to invest time into teaching me which helps me perform better and meet his expectations more easily.

But I have to say the community seems a bit crazy sometimes. I mean, ""you can smoke everywhere! It's just steam it can't harm anybody!""... What bollocks. Your lungs don't absorb everything. Of course there will be nicotine in whatever you blow out. Or all the other things that might be in there. I also don't get the ""you can smoke everywhere!"" part. Yes, it might not be as dangerous and cigarettes but like I said, there's still nicotine. And not everybody wants to have somebody blowing stuff into their face around. And people might get uncomfortable with people around them ""smoking"" even if it's not real smoke.

And what's up with the ""no regulation hurp durp!"" stuff? Wouldn't you want the government to enforce standards? 

Anyway, what you posted seems very reasonable. I would not smoke it inside anyway, nicotine is still not harmless and it's pretty stupid calling a product ""healthy"" if they don't even know the long term affects.

Edit: Something that's probably interesting from your link here, I know a lot of people that only smoked shisha but once they stopped that, they started to smoke cigarettes.

You also fail to address the crux of my argument, which is your complete disregard for basic economics principles like ceteris paribus and the law of demand.

When I asked for more evidence and rhetoric, I was indeed asking for present evidence. Some sort of scientific study or article along with some more persuasive commentary possibly would have changed my mind about the issue.

&gt;Can you give me a source that Japanese people follow formal legality more than they follow the law of demand?

Certainly, there is a huge demand for electronics in Japan as Japan has the largest electronics industry in the world. Though this demand is present, looting and theft are practically nonexistent. During the Fukushima tsunami crisis, looting was not even on the radar. Contrast this with Europe and America where looting is always going to be a problem.

http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2011/03/stop_thief_thank_you.html

&gt;I don't follow your rhetoric that somehow Asian countries are all the same and frankly I find it racist.

I wouldn't suggest that all Asian countries are the same, however I believe it is negligent to suggest that they are too different to compare. Japan and China share a lot of cultural heritage.

&gt;No. The state is a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence formed through concentration of armed force in the body of the sovereign for the express purpose of relieving humanity of its purportedly unselfmanaging nature. The formation of sovereign bodies has hitherto been performed through hierarchical striation along the boundaries of class dictatorships. States serve the good of those bodies that constitute the formative kingmaker class of society that can constitute itself as dictator. They do not serve everyone. This is evidenced in a myriad of ways, but since we're arguing on the internet, I figure I might as well drop the classic example of the Holocaust, wherein the state was willing to serve the general welfare of all people only inasmuch as 11+ millions of people were considered to be not people.

The state most certainly does not have a monopoly on force. In democratic countries, the sovereign of the state is the people. If the people think they are ill-governed, the people can change the government. If the government will not change then revolution is the only recourse. Many governments have been overturned through violent revolutions. Recent studies have even suggested that all it takes is 3.5% of a population to overturn a government.

http://rationalinsurgent.com/2013/11/04/my-talk-at-tedxboulder-civil-resistance-and-the-3-5-rule/

&gt;Wrong. It is not in the interest of women seeking abortions. Inasmuch as the state has a duty to prevent underpopulation, it is not best resolved by abortion. Further, there is no evidence that this will affect billions of people.

It would be in the long term interest of women seeking abortions. I am now persuaded that it would not be best resolved by prohibition, however there is good evidence that a lack of laborers will lead to an economic recession or depression, and such a depression will definitely effect billions as Japan is the third largest economy in the world.

&gt;Cereal is sold at grocery stores. Milk is sold at grocery stores, too. Grocery stores employ workers. Let's say we have ten workers who work at a grocery store that exclusively sells cereal and milk. Let's also say that this grocery store is a monopoly and therefore its sales are representative of aggregate demand for both milk and cereal in the economy where it resides. All ten of these workers handle both cereal and milk in their occupational duties. If the store were to stop selling cereal because of a government decree that cereal is causing a dangerously negative birth rate, but were to continue selling milk, the store would still be representative of the aggregate demand for milk. The workers, formerly charged with sale of both milk and cereal, now will be charged solely with the sale of milk. However, this store represents the aggregate demand. They can try to substitute milk for cereal to some extent by diverting productive resources for the sale of cereal to the sale of milk, but this effectively will serve the purpose of shifting the price of milk downwards along the demand curve while not substantially recovering the sales normally allocated to cereal. The marginal rate of substitution for milk and cereal, you see, is not perfect. To some extent, substitution falls flat. So, even though the store still sells milk, and its workers are perfectly trained and capable of selling milk, approximately half of the workers will be laid off. Abortion is cereal. Other procedures are milk. It might not be half, but to disregard potential economic effects on the basis that health care professionals have more than one function is irresponsible

I suppose it would be negligent to disregard potential economic effects of outlawing abortion. However I'm not convinced that the economic ramifications would outweigh the benefits of adding another 200,000 - 300,000 people into the economy.

&gt;Women make up (more than) half the labor force and spend their wages as (more than) half of the consumer base. There is the potential for the economy to be cut in half in a few short years.

I'm afraid I'm not convinced that out of 60 million women, a couple hundred thousand of them putting their careers on hold would cut the economy in half.

&gt;Who are you to purpose your thought as law of nature? I'll again ask why should I care what you think? I don't see any conceivable reason in the absence of all evidence, that I am making an overestimation. From this section of the response, you also ignore the potential impacts of women made infertile, dead, or prisoner by proposed measures for criminalization of abortion.

I believe you are the one who is trying to persuade me. If you don't care what I think then why are you putting so much effort into persuasion?

&gt;This is self-contradicting. It either works, doesn't work, or is inconclusive. These classifications don't overlap. What's more, if a criminalization of abortion were put into effect, the same claim could be used to unilaterally dismiss it. You lack a metric by which to evaluate the efficacy of methods but insist on the superiority of your own proposition on grounds of blind faith.

I believe that this trichotomy is really a spectrum of certainty. A point has a level of certainty which changes continuously with new information arriving. 

&gt;I'll top this off with one new argument to keep things fresh: immigration policy reform stands a far greater chance at increasing the Japanese population than criminalized abortion.

I'm afraid I have already awarded a delta for this good point.

ps: you really ought to take a course on Aristotelian rhetoric. The way you debate is quite combative and is not conducive to persuading anyone. Persuasion is really an art which comprises compelling points, interesting illustrations, inspiring dialogue, and friendly prodding among other things.",changemyview,t5_2w2s8,0.0,

I work out at my university gym, and the majority of people there were varsity athletes and I was nervous about working out around them. But when I finally made my way into the weight room, I realized everybody there is too busy doing their own thing to take the time to judge you. Nobody is born with a sixpack or able to bench their body weight, and more importantly nobody expects you to either. The hardest part about going to the gym is going regularly, and the easiest way to do that is to just take that first step in your morning routine. If you lug your bag around all day, I guarantee you will be motivated to work out. Good luck and have fun!

I'm so glad that instead you've taken your time with this, that you acknowledge that everyone forming their own interpretations is central to the movie's experience, and that you're catering to the audience that have already seen, understood, and interpreted the film and that this is instead a technical analysis of details that probably were overlooked by a large majority of people.

My only criticism is that you should probably have added a disclaimer towards the beginning for anyone that hasn't seen the movie that this video will make almost zero sense (although I'm personally happy that you're not making this one noob friendly).

&gt; Second, the commercial number of Velocity-only webapps can be counted on one hand. In 17 years as a professional developer--since 1999 on Java--I have never seen a professional organization release any view technology that was not, ultimately, based on JSP. Surely, it's technically possible to deploy something only on a Velocity front end but it's simply not done.

You've *never* seen a Java web application that *doesn't* use JSP?  I'll accept that, I've interviewed developers that have *never* used a debugger.  However your assertion that it is ""simply not done"" is flat out wrong.  Many projects do not use JSP at all and furthermore how often JSP is used isn't even relevant.  You asserted JSP is the *foundation* of *all* view technologies and it simply isn't the foundation of *any* of those view technologies.

&gt; Spring MVC--which I have deep and extensive experience with--is a Swiss army knife that can be used with many other technologies--but 99% of its uses include JSP.

If you're going to use hyperbole why don't you go all the way and claim JSP is used 100% of the time?  Heck, you already did when you claimed there aren't any Java web applications that don't use JSP in the first place.  Would you care to substantiate this rather bold assertion? 

Around here the mere suggestion that we should use JSP would likely get a rather interesting response.

&gt; So, it appears you're just trying to speak in asterisks and edge cases for the dubious point of finding exceptions to the obvious rules that I stated clearly. Every one of your ""exceptions"" the the general rules I laid out are microsopic edge cases that are never used professionally.

So you are asserting that:

1. Thymeleaf is *never* used professionally.
2. Velocity is *never* used professionally.
3. Freemarker is *never* used professionally.
4. Other non-HTML based rendering (e.g. XML, JSON, YAML) using libraries such as JAXB or Jackson (both of which Spring MVC supports out of the box) are *never* used professionally.

Seriously?

&gt; Surely, it's possible to write a Spring MVC app that writes full HTML instead of using JSP but can you suggest one professional application that does this, when the full suite of JSP-dependent technologies are right there?

To begin with I never once mentioned rendering HTML in the first place, so I'm not sure why you're attached to it.  Are you under the impression that Spring MVC only supports rendering HTML?  Perhaps you're going to claim it can but *nobody* does that either.

Last but not least, I must re-iterate, not a single one of the technologies I listed are *dependent* on JSP and not a single one of them has JSP as their *foundation*.

P.S. You may want to inform the Spring team that 9 of the 10 view technologies they support out of the box are ""never used professionally"" so as to save them the work of supporting them.",java,t5_2qhd7,1.0,

No, it is a cultural and traditional thing, however I am not unhappy it was done to me. In fact, if I could go back and have a say, I'd say, ""do it while I'm young and won't remember it.""

I would posit that one does not have to *intend* to cause harm to actually cause it. And I'm not just saying that from the ""heathen is orthopraxic and what you do is more important than what you intend or what you believe"" standpoint, I'm saying that from the perspective of someone who has accidentally run over a dog, accidentally upset someone who lost a parent by mentioning mine, accidentally given someone a bloody nose with my elbow while stretching. It is objectively true that malicious intent is not required to do harm. I mean, shit. Thorin and Aleglad and I certainly aren't malicious in our posting here and it seems to have caused *all kinds* of grief. Does that make the position a little more relatable?

&gt;Someone called him a racist, and he agreed. That's my sum total knowledge of him and that ends my interest in discussion with him.

I think you need to read his post again, unless you're talking about someone different. I only saw a guy admitting to being folkish, and outright denying that it was tied to racism. [This is the guy you meant, right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Wicca/comments/2qv3y2/ask_a_heathen/cnaedjq)

&gt;It's irony again - because the stances I've outlined above should make this my statement and your rejection, right? 

We can disagree without dragging that baggage into every interaction. I disagree with /u/HereticHierophant on *so many things.* I still consider her a close friend of mine.

I mean, if you believed we're capable of an uneasy truce with goddamn nazis (and we aren't, but your impression was such that we could manage that level of passiveness), don't you think we can manage the same with you guys? I would certainly say that we disagree with you at least *slightly* less than we do with white nationalists. :P

&gt;I just don't think a dialogue, at the moment, would do anything but radically offend both sides. 

I think that blame is being very wrongly laid on our side of the fence in this instance, is all. We've been very civil, very pleasant. Uncharacteristically so. And you guys have met us... Well, kind of like heathens, honestly. Shit, isn't the fact that *that* happened evidence that we could get along with?

&gt;I think you should wait for the end of troubled waters before you start talking about bridge repair

Then stop stirring them up. Because it's you doing it, not me. It's you calling us nazis. It's you calling us bullies when we invite you into our hall in good faith, where you might get a good ribbing, but you're not going to be genuinely disrespected unless you walk in and like, call us nazis or something.

As much as it *deeply* pains me to say so (kidding! Mostly!) there are good things in Wicca. There are good people in Wicca. Likewise, there are good things and good people in heathenry. I probably disagree with a lot of heathens as much as I disagree with you, albeit about different things. But there can be some common cause the moment *both parties* say ""We can't go anywhere if all we do is bring up old grievances.""

I'm also very stoked to how all the characters are wanting to not be ""proper,"" they're so meta enough to defy the typical writer's expectations for a conclusion or purpose in an arc.  It's also intentional by the author -Nisio, so it's like meta meta, or something like that.  I'm not sure if there's a term for that or I just have a terrible vocabulary bank.  Anyways, I'm stoked for whatever is going to be next because it seems like the characters are all going to try to be more meta and unpredictable onwards.

The significance of Tadatsuri and Yozuru not being able to touch the ground because of paranoia or a curse was definitely interesting.  I always thought that Yozuru was trying to not touch the ground because she wants to look down upon Koyokoyo but that seems to not be the case.  I'm guessing they'll touch upon this more later since that wasn't the focus of the arc.

So, does anyone know if the zoom in Arararagi's neck with two bite marks like a vampire near the end will mean anything in the future?  I'm starting to think Shinobu bit him right before Koyomi was about to fight but Shinobu didn't expect that Tadasuri (I can't spell/remember his name - the guy who kidnaps little girls) to blow up from Yotsugi.  Unless... Koyomi has turned into a vampire and couldn't go back... too much speculation at this point.

I liked the soundtrack, it definitely accompanied some great moments.  I also was definitely not bored with the dialogue since I found it to be quite engaging.  If I could I would've liked to slow every frame down and ponder on what they were trying talking about but that'll take a while so that'll happen again during my rewatch in the future.

Also, the relation between Yotsugi and an idol made me lol.  I wonder if they were trying to make fun of the idol things or pander to it... Poe's law.

Come on,i said that after getting a kill,your ult cooldown is about 30 seconds shorter than most midlaners' CDs

&gt;~30 s shorter ultimate cooldown than your opponent

For example,syndra's ult CD is 100s at lvl 1,kata's is 90s

90s-15s=75s

100s-25s≈30s

&gt;Why wouldn't I be harassed while autoattacking?

&gt;It goes down by 15 seconds, but it's not like I'm actually going to get to use it to harass unless the enemy laner fucks up hard.

&gt;Why would you be at low health in-lane against a champion who can neither burst you nor harass you?

&gt;I don't really need to save it because it's a waste of time to gank a champion who gets fucked in lane and doesn't scale into lategame. The enemy laner sorts things out and the enemy jungler gets to win another lane.

&gt;If you do that shit just to try to harass someone in a teamfight you get killed.

&gt;

By saying

&gt;I've smurfed a couple times too. It's pretty relaxing. Sometimes I'll go AD Kassadin.

You are actually negating all i said in the

&gt;You just Q for cs all the time and QEW the enemy laner when you feel like it.

&gt;If you get a kill,you come back to lane with ~30 s shorter ultimate cooldown than your opponent and you are actually able
 to use your ult just for harass because fuck you.

&gt;Dives are a piece of cake cause resets,ganks are either easy to escape or just a doublekill cause resets and AOE

part

And thus you are negating the ""farm with Q"" and ""if you kill someone under tower you can get back easily"" part.

Therefore,my ""You farm with autos not being harassed?"" corresponds to you negating that  ""You just Q for cs all the time""

And so on.

Same with the ""Or does your enemy have some kind of long range targeted hard cc?"" corresponding to you negating ""ganks are either easy to escape,or...""

&gt;If you do that shit just to try to harass someone in a teamfight you get killed.

I didn't mean harassing,i mean that if someone is fighting with an other someone,you should propably help him (if it's indeed a teamfight,not someone wanting to 2v4 with you)

&gt;Not if even one person saves one hard CC for her because she actually can't do anything without her ult.

415+130%AP AOE (4 people max)damage and 575+170% AP single target damage say otherwise.(4 ppl count for aoe dmg and 1 counts for single target since Q applies to 5 targets to be perfectly clear).

&gt;Except she doesn't. Her lane phase is garbage

You and your opponent are likely to end laning phase with 0/0 if you dont do stupid things and dont roam anywhere.

If you roam bot,you are likely to end up 2/0 or something like that.

If you farm well,you end up as a pretty decent assassin,if you get some kills,you end up as a **very** decent assassin

Saying ""i've got no kill potential=my laning phase is garbage"" is like saying ""nasus doesn't have kill potential in late vs jax,his laning is garbage""

Since you are the only aoe reset assassin in the game,with each creep you gain more than the other champions as you are not limited to bursting one champion/harassing champions

&gt;it's a waste of time to gank a champion who gets fucked in lane

If you manage to Kill ~~Bill~~ Katarina once or twice,she ends up useless since she brings only damage to any teamcomp

&gt;The fact you're calling post-rework Kassadin's pre-6 bad says a lot.

If he'd have a good pre-6,his post-6 would be monstrously strong.

For example today was 225 lbs so my warmup was:
2 x 5 @ 45 lbs (empty bar) 
1 x 5 @ 95 lbs
1 x 5 @ 135 lbs
1 x 3 @ 185 lbs
1 x 2 @ 205 lbs

Maybe the ballsy AI would go in first while the others who don't trust what happened tumble in later.

As for items that require channeling I would love some spells/items with spells to be specifically REALLY hard to get but are uber powerful but act much like the shield where it immobilizes them. This way special mages would get the spell and use them during peak rally calls. Imagine mass shields around cities and hostile AI can't enter. Would be epic. Maybe they have like HUGE cooldowns so they aren't just constantly using them or burn after using once.

Dave and the team said they wanted to create a community and communities need those pull characters, the ""Leeroy Jenkins"" and other badass characters that you see in the city and go OMG THATS THEM!, Having these special items would help that a LOT. As long as they are extremely hard to get and rare these celebrity adventures would be ""household"" names instead of what happened to other MMO's where the only recognizable names are of the trolls that spam city chats for a month straight then get replaced by the next one. 

The biggest problem though is that with enough time these items could become common enough to where they are constantly upheaving the world environment and making the game feel wild and sporadic to the point it's just no fun. The world has to feel like a normal fantasy realm with a normal day to day that not much happens and then tops once a week something crazy happens somewhere. ",EQNext,t5_2saln,1.0,

Also I've avoided sports manga and only included fighting type action manga. If you're also interested in sports manga I can make some recommendations for that as well.

666 Satan - Mostly pretty mediocre but is written by Kishimoto Seishi, who is the brother of Kishimoto Masashi (Naruto). Overall probably a 6-7/10 but has some good moments. (Note this has only 78 chapters but was published in a monthly format so it's equivalent to 200+ weekly)

Cage of Eden - Has many scifi/mystery elements like Psyren. Less action more suspense but overall solid minus the ending most people don't like. 185 chapters

Change Guy - Martial Arts / School manga. Has good moments but also some overall slowness. 338 chapters

Chrono Crusade (initial printing was Chrno Crusade) - Fantasy/Historical action manga with romantic elements. A bit shorter but still a solid read especially if you enjoy the historical aspects. 57 chapters


Full Metal Panic! - Mecha / military type with many comedy elements and a touch of comedic romance. Again not quite 100 chapters but most are of month-long length (40~ pages). 91 chapters but ~250 for weekly equivalence. 

The Lucifer and Biscuit Hammer - One of the funniest manga I've ever read. True ""anti-hero"", very unique story. Also called Hoshi no Samidare. 65 actual chapters but of month length (~120 weekly)

Nijiiro Togarashi  - By the legend, Mitsuru Adachi. Mostly well known for his sports manga, this is a manga set in historical japan. Mostly comedic, the art style may take some getting useful as the chracters look the same in all Adachi manga. However I think he's one of the best storytellers

&gt; Street Cred is applied as a positive Limit Modifier to all Social Tests in situations where the character’s reputation would be known.

Since Street Cred is the positive side of Running, and Notoriety is the negative side of Running... I'd say that Notoriety points should be applied as negative Social Limit penalties.

Having a high Street Cred, you get bonuses to interacting with Fixers, Johnsons, and Contacts. Having a high Notoriety, you get penalties to those same kinds of people.

Nobody knew where the beast came from, what it wanted, nor even what it looked like. Nobody had seen it, but we all knew it was there. We saw its tracks, huge six-fingered paw prints, left in the snow. We heard its roars, deep and unearthly bellows, echoing over the frozen lakes. The sled dogs were much too terrified of the beast to want to go out there. The snowmobiles didn't have the fuel to go track the beast.

And no one was going to come in to help us. Our town was too remote. Everyone was afraid.

Night after night the beast came through our town. It roared, it snarled, it bellowed, but no one was brave enough to look at it. Everyone had their doors locked, their lights out, their shades drawn. To the beast, we were as good as dead.

Which would soon be true. Food was running short. We couldn't hold out much longer.

One day we faced the inevitable. We were down to our last cans. The stores had long since been picked clean. If I didn't go out and find something, anything, to eat, we were going to starve. I suited up for the cold, armed myself with my father's hunting rifle, and went outside.

A mile or so outside of town I found deer tracks. The beast's prints were nowhere to be seen. I followed the tracks into the forest.

Hour after hour I trudged through the snow, but still the deer was nowhere to be seen. No matter how far I went, the deer had gone still further. Sunset was fast approaching. I would have to go back empty handed.

As I turned around to head back, the air became very still. I stopped and waited. Nothing happened. It was quiet. Too quiet.

And then the wind picked up. It grew stronger and stronger, whipping up the snow around me. Very soon I could see nothing but snow, and the wind was deafeningly loud. It was rapidly getting dark. I hurried back as fast as I could, but I was hopelessly lost. My tracks became obscured in the blizzard. I fell to my knees.

Without warning the wind let up and once again everything was quiet. Night had fallen. And I heard breathing. Heavy breathing. I looked up.

The beast stood in front of me. It was titanic. It had black fur and hideously red eyes. Its canines were visible and menacingly sharp. It was hunched up and staring at me, ready to pounce.

I scrambled to my feet and aimed at the beast. Neither of us moved. We stared at each other, waiting for the other to make the first move.

I realized that shooting it would have done me no good. It would only make it angrier than it already was. So I decided to try the unthinkable.

I tossed the rifle to the side and walked towards the beast.

The beast did not move at first. Then it relaxed and took a few cautious steps toward me. We drew closer to each other.

When we met, we stopped. Neither of us moved. We simply took each other in. Then, very slowly, and very carefully, I reached my hand towards the beast.

I laid it gently on the side of its head. The beast was still at first. Then it let the weight of its head into my hand and closed its eyes. We remained like this.

Suddenly the beast opened its eyes and picked its head back up. It turned off to the side and put its face close to the snow. It gave a low, sonorous growl, and the snow cleared off before it. In the spot it had cleared a shagawa bush sprouted and grew to full size. Its berries glistened purple among the snow, shining in the starlight. The beast looked up, and an aurora came dancing into the sky. It spat and sparked tongues of gold, red, and green, illuminating the night. The beast looked back towards me.

I smiled, and stretched my hand to the beast once more. It accepted my hand, and together we turned and headed home.",WritingPrompts,t5_2s3nb,2.0,

After an Intelligence has been active for a while (I originally wrote ""around for a while"" but this is inaccurate, all Intelligences are eternal, but some just kind of sit around doing nothing while others explore their surroundings,) it gains the ability to influence more and more matter and energy, thus ascending towards greater and greater degrees of Godhood. But the more you have influence over, the harder it is to observe every single individual particle.

So as you ascend in degrees of Godhood, you recruit other Intelligences that are just becoming active to sort of subcontract these particles for you. As you evolve into a more and more complex entity, you recruit more and more Intelligences and organize into more and more elaborate structures and substructures.

There is a spiritual evolution, each phase of which is coupled with a phase of physical evolution. You organize a more complex spiritual (spirit = plasma/electricity or something very similar) form, then incarnate into a solid form that matches it. After accruing experience in that solid form, you return to a purely spiritual form and take what you've learned (learning is much easier in a material form) and evolve your spiritual body (with or without help, see below,) then re-incarnate, taking on a physical structure that mirrors your new spiritual form.

In addition to reincarnation, there is resurrection.

Resurrected beings have the immortality of spirit and the solidity of physical matter. The best of both worlds, without the limitations. Once you reach this point, you are ready to take the next step, which is to assist other Intelligences in obtaining or evolving spirit bodies.

Resurrected beings can reproduce, and in doing so will create spirit bodies patterned after their own. They can re-organize spirits from lower forms too, for example a dog to a chimp. It's possible, though much more difficult, for an Intelligence to form or evolve its own spirit body (JHVH did this, hence why He is called self-created.) Once an Intelligence obtains a spirit body in this way, it can grow and learn by leaps and bounds compared to its previous state.

After creating spirit bodies, a resurrected being can fall back into mortality and begin creating physical bodies for those spirits to inhabit. This is what Adam and Eve did. They voluntarily gave up their resurrected state, after populating the Earth with spirits, in order to provide those spirits with mortal bodies so that they (we) could experience the next step.

As Adam and Eve fell, so too did the Earth, from its former place of glory at the center of the Galaxy to its present position at the tip of the Orion spiral arm. Adam and Eve left the congregation of the Elohim (Hebrew word meaning the Gods, plural, not God, singular) to rejoin mortality for our benefit. Later, JHVH did the same, but whereas Adam and Eve fell to bring death on themselves, JHVH incarnated as the man Yeshua Ben Yusuf of Nazareth to bring eternal life on Adam and Eve and all their progeny.

The Egyptian religion depicts the spirits of sinners (those whose hearts are heavier than the feather of Maat) being fed to Ammit, the crocodile/lion/hippo goddess of chaos. Basically those whose choices have taken them to a moral dead-end are dissolved back into quantum foam to be recycled; this happens after they are given EVERY chance to take a better path.",holofractal,t5_33j70,3.0,

And psychologically, I often feel like I have the wrong sort of body for modesty.

I feel like I get this from other women too - a lot of people assume I put a lot of work into my ""figure"", maybe I'm wearing lots of padding or have implants, or that I'm on a diet and focused on my weight all the time.

When I finally reached my house, my mother gifted me the copy of Destiny she bought while I was at school. I rushed to my PS3, opened up the disc tray and put Destiny in. The game loaded, and I was amazed. The graphics were beautiful (for PS3 standards), the environment was so rich, and I could feel how my character was feeling after Dinklebot brought *us* back to life. I completed the first mission, and when I finally got to the tower I was amazed. So many low level Guardians in the same situation as me. Looking around, discovering new places and meeting each other. But that was 3 months ago now. I am now a 28 Warlock who has completed the Vault multiple times, helped lower levels complete missions and now have two alts. 

But now as the Christmas Noobs start their adventure, their way will be partially paved for them. Knowing what lies ahead. Knowing about Exotics and how to beat bosses. We did not. I am proud to say that I am a Day One Guardian.

So, one of the best things about the typical Pokemon world is that it's relatively modern. There're lamps and cell phones and all kinds of things that you don't get in a D&amp;D game.

I recently ran a fight where the players were stuck in a traffic jam on the freeway into town. Some very large Dragon Warrior-style golems (not the Pokemon ""Golem"") were blocking traffic. The players got out of their commuter bus, walk between the cars, and tell the truck driver at the front of the line to record them on his cell phone. They then proceed to start fighting the golems.

The golems had been there for a few hours, so they'd had time to bunker down. They had come up through the road, so there were large pits in the way; they also had Stealth Rock deployed to make sure any cars that moved would get a rock through the windshield. They also had magical orbs, one per golem, that did more support functions (they drain health, and then give it back to the golem). And they're defensive powerhouses anyway, of course - so they're in this fight for the long haul.

My players beat them to a pulp, of course, with one particularly buff player tanking a golem and its energy orb for about half the fight. It was a seriously hard fight.

I'm not aware of any theories that would let us use these particles to travel faster than light ourselves, so it doesn't really apply to the *original* example, but technically going faster than the speed of light is *not* impossible in this Universe - you just have to be a tachyon.

What's impossible is accelerating to or beyond the speed of light (like I said, the theoretical particles in question already exist at speeds faster than light, and applying energy to them makes them go *slower* - so they also can't 'accelerate' to the speed of light).  It's perfectly permissible to travel *at* the speed of light (if you're a photon), and in theory you can even go faster than it.

We will use some kind of warping of space to make the space the ship exists in *seem* to travel faster than light relative to surrounding reference points, while never actually accelerating the ship itself to relativistic speeds.  Or we will create or harness wormholes and the curvature of space to travel between two points while cutting out part of the distance in between.  Or some other method that we haven't even conceived of.

We'll never find a way to magically violate relativity and actually make a particle with mass accelerate to or beyond the speed of light.

I began this project for two reasons 

- 1) I’m thinking of writing some Dragon Age fiction, so I wanted to get a good handle on the political situation and population centers of Thedas.  [For this reasons, I’ll likely also be making a series of political maps detailing Fereldan and Orlais].  

- 2) There weren’t any good maps online that showed political borders, so I wanted to introduce my head-canon to the general populace.  

As I mentioned earlier, I used the vector drawing software Inkscape to make the map.  It took around a month, (likely only a couple days of actual labor, but I’m writing a thesis).

*

Anderfels:

[Design]  The Anderfels are noted as being blight-ridden and much of the landscape consists of deserted steppes.  As such, I treated the area like I would a desert, limiting most populations to areas around rivers and the coastline.  The country covers a large area, but likely has one of the smallest populations in Thedas.  As such, despite the country being said to extend to the Donarks, there doesn’t seem to be the population available to extend the control that far north.

There are two ethnic groups in the Anderfels, the Anders and the Orth.  The Anders can be found in the valleys created by the Lattenfluss river and around lakes.  Another group can be found around Weisshaupt, which tends to act more as the capital of the region then the seat of the king in Hossberg.

The Orth are a nomadic society, living in the Wandering Hills in the North.  Unlike the Anders, their light settlement can be more considered ‘places where the Orth are likely to be’ rather than places that are continuously settled.  This can be also seen with the various Dalish clans.

[Head-canon Lore]  The Anders are noted as having their own separate language which named the Darkspawn (Hurlocks, Genlock, etc).  I imagine them as being one of the first populations conquered by Tevinter, but largely left alone due to having little of value in their land (perhaps they were raiders or something of the like?).  They maintained their own language and have largely resisted foreign encroachment on their lands.

*

Seheron:

[Design]  Seheron is densely forested, having a large jungle dominating the center of the island.  Despite this, it is one of the oldest Tevinter settlements and likely densely populated despite the large-scale warfare that’s taken place there.  As such, the only place completely barren of light settlement is the mountain range that runs alone the center and the densest jungle.

There are four groups fighting over Seheron: the Qunari, the Tal-Vashoth, the Tevinters, and the Fog Warriors.  The Qunari dominate the eastern portion of the island, but face opposition everywhere else despite their nominal control.  They have large settled populations near Alam and near the large Tal-Vashoth contingent in the North, but their main strength is the city of Seheron and the outlying islands.

The Tevinters are largely hated on Seheron due to the destructive nature of their war effort against the Qunari, but I gave them a still somewhat loyal population in the very south of the island, mostly seen in the city of Alam.  This is simply because I doubt that all of the island would completely abandon the empire, but this group is small and growing smaller the longer the Imperium does not control the island.

The Fog Warrior and the Tal-Vashoth are shown as one group, though broad areas of control are labeled.  As far as naming - the Nahari are named after the ‘Cure of Nahar’, which brought the long lasting fog to the island.  The warrior guerilla tactics that the Fog Warrior practice likely relies on the fog, but the name also extends to the native population of the island that does not fight.
The Tal-Vashoth occupy the northern peninsula of Seheron.  I am not sure if they seek to create a new non-Qun state, or if they simply wish to be left alone, or if they are the beasts the Qun claim them to be.  In any case, they have a large presence in the jungles of the island.

[Head-canon Lore]  Seheron and Alam are quite large cities, despite the destruction that encompassed much of the countryside.  They used to be about equal in size, but as both likely relied on the importation of food, Seheron has grown much larger while Alam has grown weaker.

*

Par Vollen:

[Design]  Not much to say, really, as we know little about Qunari homeland.  The Qunari control the entire island, though the heavily forested interior is left alone.  Qunandar is extremely large and is the only large-scale settlement on the island, though much of the coastline is also likely heavily populated.

The Fex are a pre-Qunari people who occupy parts of the eastern peninsula of the island.  They are extremely few in number from what I can tell of the lore, and likely are controlled politically by the Qunari.

[Head-canon Lore]  The native language of the Fex has likely long been suppressed in favor of Qunlat.

*

Tevinter Imperium:

[Design]  Due to Tevinter being the longest existing human country in Thedas, I knew at the start that they would have a large amount of heavily populated areas.  While likely smaller in population than Orlais, the Tevinter Imperium is quite strong and its reach extends into regions that have likely would have little-to-no settlement like the (desert?) Silent Plains and the Hundred Pillars.  They also control the Arlathan forest, preying upon the Dalish there who still consider it their home.

The population is concentrated on the coast, with the vast majority of it located on the peninsula that Minrathous rests on.  Like on Seheron, the High Reaches mountain chain has little settlement and can be clearly seen on the map.

A number of the surrounding islands also have large scale Tevinter settlement and likely form bases of operation for actions against Qunari-controlled Seheron.
[Head-canon Lore] Due to the long-history of Tevinter settlements, I give a number of sub-types to their culture named after powerful cities and geographical areas.  These identities do not compare in stature to loyalty to Minrathous, but a sort of provincialism does exist.

You glossed over a big point of my relatively short post: intersex people. What do you do if someone is XY and has a vagina, or XX and has a penis (this does occur, by the way)? That conflicts with your view because you've decided that male=XY+penis and female=XX+vagina. There's no room to put them. That's the problem with the chromosomal and genital definitions. It's just not that simple.

If you believe that being trans is a delusion I would invite you to review the definition of what qualifies as a delusion.

If the matter were simply of her being homosexual, why would she not have simply identified as a homosexual male? There's no small number of homosexual men in the US, and they live perfectly happy lives thanks to growing support for homosexual rights. If it were a matter only of her being attracted to men - which is not something that has been established about her, to my knowledge - there would be no reason for her to come out as trans.

&gt;Nope, only women are in touch with their emotions, if you feel feelings as a man, it means you must be a woman! I'm sorry but I just genuinely do not believe that for a second.

I'm not sure what you mean here. Do you mean that the first sentence is how you believe Leelah felt? If so, I imagine there was quite a bit more thought on her part about being trans than that.

I'm going to hope you have conventional (i.e., pro-equality) views on homosexuality for the rest of this post. I will contrast homosexuality and transexuality in hopes that I can extricate one from the other in your worldview.

Homosexuality and transexuality are similar, though not so similar as to be the same thing, as you believe. You are likely also a subscriber to the idea that almost all differences between men and women are a product of societal norms. While there is an extent to which that's true, there are differences that are not caused, or are at least not entirely caused, by societal norms. Patterns in brain activity, for example, are markedly different for men and women.

Here's the kicker: trans men (i.e., men born into bodies you would describe as female) display the patterns of brain activity associated with men, just as trans women display the patterns associated with women. Thus it is not really a simplification to say that a trans person is a person whose brain and body do not match in gender.

Further, transexuals can be sexually attracted to any sex. That is to say, they can be homosexual or heterosexual (relative to either the sex they were designated as at birth or the sex they identify as, it doesn't really matter). The sexuality of a trans person is entirely different from their gender identity.",MorbidReality,t5_2tz1e,1.0,

A gun doesn't have a up and down recoil (anything with a stock) but rather a back and forth recoil. 

GUNS HAVE AMMO!!! everyone has a limited amount of ammo.

You can't out run gun fire. Like when you see the hero running and then you see a bunch of bullet hits behind him... Uh uh. It would simply take a small adjustment of the weapon in question to get your hits on target.

If the explosion is in any way felt by the person in question (considering it's some sort of frag) you'd be full of shrapnel or torn apart.

Real explosions are almost never fiery, unless gasoline or something was hit.

Tanks don't really get obliterated, but rather get pierced.

A gun shot wound makes it very hard to move and bleeds a good deal, but aren't 100% lethal. Look at the stats for ERs with GSWs (Gun shot wounds) that survive, or at least come in alive. They had to get shot, wait at least like a minute or more, and then get driven to the hospital. Now if you pop into a room with your service revolver and pop the three guys that are guarding the door in the torso, chances are they're not going to be dead right away, especially if they're wearing kevlar. They could hypothetically still try and draw a weapon or call for back up or scream.

Getting shot in a bullet proof vest does not mean you can get up and walk and continue fighting. You'd be down for the count at that point.

Getting punched in the face makes less sound than the sound of your clothes and shoes shuffling during the fight.

Getting punched in the face is not an instant knock out and more than often is simply the beginning of the fight. I've been punched in the face many times and have never once stumbled greatly, even if it was sudden. It's surprisingly hard to knock someone down with a punch to the face.

Getting kicked/punched in the legs and sides REALLY fucking hurts. You will often stumble or crumple down a little when you get hit there.

Getting a broken leg is pretty much impossible to walk **ON**.

Getting stabbed or cut hurts, but you can almost always keep fighting after getting one of these wounds.

Fist fights hurt your hands if they're not protected. You almost never see that part.

Martial arts are almost never effective.

PLEASE please please movie people, get your action scenes right, and for the love of god, show your actors how to use a gun. Hell take them to a shooting range and get them to play air soft of paintball or something. Just please, do something.

That said, I picked up a lot of really cool pieces. My most recent has already become the favorite of my collection because I have wanted one ever since I bought my first ancient, so it was a great Christmas present to myself. This was just ordered yesterday on Vcoins actually, an Alexander the Great tetradrachm. Pictures [here](http://i.imgur.com/Ypsm9wY.jpg). Full ID: 

Alexander III AR Tetradrachm. Pella mint. Circa 325-315 BC. Head of Herakles right, wearing lion skin / Zeus enthroned left, holding eagle and sceptre; SI in left field. Mueller 1397. Price 236.

The first time I bought an ancient was at a small coin shop in Estes Park, CO. The owner was super nice, and even though I was new and only had the money to buy a few cheap late Roman/Byzantine bronzes he showed me a beautiful, nearly mint state Alexander tetradrachm and I knew I would have to buy one some day and yesterday was that day, can't wait to receive it.

What I hear when I hear ""war for profit"" is a concrete assertion of a conspiracy to wage a war because there will be a fallout of cash for vested interests - primarily military contractors, and politicians.

When I was more argumentative and I would get into this, that seemed to be the image that leftists (and certain libertarians) intended to project, while they could fall back on what was technically the truth - the United States tends to get into wars in areas where we have legitimate economic interests AND something shady is going down (for instance, why we might intercede on behalf of Kuwait or in HOA, but not really GAF about central Africa).

""War for profit"" seems to be a very imprecise and ideologically motivated way to describe the latter scenario, which I take to be the one that actually exists.

You see what's going on there? To me at least it seems that all those words are about your expectations. They look like metaphors for progress and motion. 

I mean I'm not a doctor or anything so don't mistake this for any kind professional advice - and more importantly I'm not you so I don't know if what I'm saying is true but … all those phrases seem to be suggesting that you have an expectation that there is only one direction that your life should be going in - but who says so? 

It's not me saying it, and if it's not you either … then these sound like they must be the expectations that you just *think* other people have for you. 

Does that make sense at all?

I'm trying to say that maybe it's true you can't change yourself but you can change your expectations about what you think should be happening.

On to plants!! You have many many options, and I for one loooove working with waterplants, for me it's just way more easy than real life plants, (can't drown them, harr harr) if you can get it, try an anubias plant, just make sure you tie it to your root and don't put it in the sand, after some weeks it will stick to the root by it self. 

You can certainly try many different plants, I don't like fast growing plants, because when you get good lighting in your tank it becomes a daily struggle to keep tidy, time is my friend! 

You can try making a diy Moss wall, very cool. Or tie moss to your root instead of anubias. And you can grow grass, there are some beautiful water grass that would look nice in the background.

The answer is that I meant to insert the alibi part in here. 

To your other points, how can we be in the business of determining the magnitude of lies? You are making it seem like Adnan lying to detectives the day he was interrogated as to his interaction with Hae on the day of her death is a small lie. This is not a small lie. This is a huge lie. 

I wrote my point as an exercise to remove parts of the case that are subject to key players lying. 

And again, we can always posit alternatives to any one piece of circumstantial evidence. But in this case, there are several things that point to Adnan. 

If you don't think that Adnon did it , it is hard to argue that anyone else did it other than Jay. And this doesn't make much sense. 

But this is really the part that is preventing your argument from being compelling;

""Jay's inconsistencies about things he was involved in are like the eyewitness to a crime who keeps creating a different suspect.""

They definitely have legal meaning in Australia and AFAIK England and other common law jurisdictions. To use your secure car park example, If there is a sign clearly stating that the car park operator is not responsible for certain types of damage in their car park and then you buy a ticket then you have entered into a contract which includes that clause. Courts will interpret these clauses narrowly and the exemption clause has to be within the four corners of (i.e. related to) the contract. The state and federal governments also have a range of legislation aimed at eliminating unfair terms from contracts.

What Happens:

Jaime has moved into the apartments of the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, but his sword and uniform feel ill-fitting upon him. He has been ignored by everyone in his family during Tyrion’s trial, including Cersei. He wonders if the Kingslayer is fit to occupy the title that so many great men have held before him; he is amused to discover that Ser Barristan had taken the time to record his own ousting from the Guard before leaving in the Kingsguard history book. He notes how paltry his own record seems in comparison to Ser Barristan’s, and wonders when he stopped being like Ser Arthur Dayne and more like the Smiling Knight, noted for his cruelty as much as his chivalry.",asoiaf,t5_2r2o9,12.0,

Rajon Rondo's inability to shoot the ball and his struggles at the free-throw line take him out of the conversation. Rondo is more of a Fabregas during the early years at Arsenal where he'd get bags of assists but goals seemed to elude him for some reason.

Russell Westbrook is the closest the NBA has to a Balotelli. On his day he's absolutely unstoppable and capable of taking apart teams with ease, like Balotelli against Germany in the Euros. At the same time, Westbrook's shot selection and decision-making can be a little baffling at times and he can play you out of a game.

I learned the very basic by watching him, and caught a few improvements from his videos.  Then I learned about Scott Manley and I realized That Jef is only scraping the surface of proper space flight.  I'm still at Jef level, with a lot to learn for the real pros.

Example: 

* To get into orbit the easy way: shoot straight up until your trajectory goes up to 100km or so in the map view, then cut the engine and wait to reach that altitude.  At the top, accelerate sideways, parallel to the ground, until your trajectory is an orbit.  Inefficient, but easy.

* Minor improvement: do a ""gravity turn"".  Don't go straight up, go at an angle instead.  Same principle: get your trajectory to the desired altitude and cut the engines.  When you reach the peak of the trajectory, accelerate parallel to the ground until you have an orbit.  You can also learn to use manoeuvre nodes.

* More advanced improvement: aim to the east on take-off so that you benefit from the rotation of the planet.  At all times, try to aim close to the prograde indicator as that has the best efficiency.  Don't go too fast while you're still in the atmosphere, as that too is inefficient.  Etc, etc.

There's always something to learn but there are ways to start easy first.

Paul was trying to defend his credentials as an apostle by saying he got his info straight from Jesus. He did not like the idea of being subordinate to or less than the Jerusalem pillars and tried to deny that they'd taught him anything.

&gt;Why does Paul never claim arguments concerning the resurrection between him and the disciples? 

Maybe because there weren't any? You're assuming that they claimed anything different than he did. If they were only claiming visions like Paul's, then why would there be an argument?

&gt;What's wrong with Josephus on James? 

He's probably talking about a different James. The Jesus ""called Christ"" probably refers to Jesus ben Damneus, who Josephus says was appointed High Priest in response to the killing of James. All High Priests were called Anointed/Messiah/Christ. It was a title of office. All Jewish kings were Messiahs as well.

Even Josephus doesn't say anything about this James' personal beliefs, though. Even if it is, hypothetically, about the James that Paul talks about, it doesn't say anything about him except that he was killed, It doesn't even say *why* he was killed.

Or do you want to spend your days managing a team of writers, managing a website, managing affiliate relationships, building a social following, performing basic SEO, etc?

I've been making my full time living in internet marketing for over a decade now. Blogs and content sites generally fold in the first 3-6 months because the people who start them miscalculate the amount and type of work that is required to keep a site stocked with fresh content. Start a survivalist blog and you won't be a survivalist, you'll be a full-time webmaster and writer. Is that what you do with your free time when you're fortunate enough to get some? Sit down and write for two hours?

My advice, for whatever it means (or doesn't)... You should do one topic with better content than anyone else is providing. And for a gear-focused market, this means youtube videos and product reviews. And those companies aren't going to mail you freebies for reviewing until you've got a following. And those visitors aren't going to seek you out or read your blog or click your ads or buy your affiliate products just based on how well you write about starting a fire with dryer lint. Write about that for a few months and then check your site stats, you'll be one blog of 10,000 publishing the same thing, and you'll have to split the already-limited pool of potential visitors with them. And they've got a head start.

Pick a category of product that you consider yourself to be an absolute subject matter expert on. Something you've owned a bunch of, and that you're fairly up-to-date on. Start by buying things at your local Lowes or Cabelas or wherever. Get a cheap telescoping tripod and a decent video camera. Write out the bullets for a review, make it, watch the video, make it again. Rinse and repeat. Then return the shit to the store.

You need original content that will keep people coming back. Stuff they can't read in the Amazon product description or on some forum. Guns are better than tents, because gun people never stop buying or reading about guns. Campers aren't buying 4-5 tents per year. But you'll also have pretty thin pickings for affiliate partners if you're talking guns.

&gt;__Chris Martin__ of The Chris Martin Band
&gt;__Coldplay__ (aka U2) is a Radiohead cover band also known as ___The Chris Martin Band.___ Taken into the hearts of everyone, Coldplay garnered a reputation of being ""lovely sane lads"" (Sir Paul McCartney). Legend has it that there are three more members of Coldplay apart from just Chris Martin. As of November 2011, these band members have yet to reveal themselves to the public, while speculation has mounted in the past about who, or what, they really are.  Most notably in 2007, The Daily Telegraph ran an investigation into who the drummer was, confirming it was the late __Dennis Hopper.__ Coldplay have since denied this, claiming that Dennis is too much of a nice guy.

Highs: Attended 5 festivals (Northwest Arkansas, Omaha, IJA, Kansas City, St. Louis). Finally got solid control of upside-down box. Made a few videos. Got some pattern tutorial animations accepted by the Library of Juggling site. Developed a decent system for organizing my pattern research.

Lows: Missing the EJC and JJF.

Goals: Teach some workshops - yes (IJA and Kansas City festivals). Upside-down box - yes. Seven balls - nope. Perform at least once - yes (Kansas City festival renegade show). 2/3 of IJA/EJC/JJF - nope.

Banes: Weird elbow nerve pain, but fortunately it only lasted a couple weeks. Not having enough time to practice.

Crushes: Emil Dahl's magnetic club routine, Michael Falkov, Dan Barron, Kota Hayashi, Luke Burrage, Jugglology, Jonathan Root's mustache, the Dinner and a Show show.

Surprises: Won a couple prizes (IJA tutorial contest, Bravo Juggling photo contest). When Juggling.tv featured one of my videos. Some amazing new friends.",juggling,t5_2qs90,6.0,

That's the perception of separation (ego) talking. *""I want to connect with the ocean, said the wave to the whirlpool.""*

You can't connect with it, because you *are* it. The sentence *""I want to connect with ... ""* and the belief that the sentence carries any meaning in relation to what is true is what creates the preception of separation between *I* and *not-I*, between *self* and *other*. The ego as a symbol of self-reference is expressed emotionally as precisely the desire to connect with *it*.

Sure.

&gt; They wouldn't have occasion to assuage their suffering by rationalizing a ""greater good"", like humans do.

I think I agree, but this seems like what I already said in my first reply and it also seems like a counterargument to your main point, so I am confused.

&gt; The sole source f motivation they have is survival. 

Um, possibly. Our own motivations and abilities result from the natural selection process too though. So if an animal is afraid of something and runs away and we call this motivated by survival (even though the animal isn't thinking about abstract concepts like that it may possibly die) then it doesn't seem completely clear that a human's (admitted more complex) process of motivation couldn't be called motivated by survival (or more accurately genetic propagation) either.

Why does someone run 20km when his survival doesn't require it? Well, it's more likely that individuals that are particularly fit or have distinguished themselves will breed and pass on their genetic material which increases the likelihood of such individuals being represented in the population.",philosophy,t5_2qh5b,3.0,

Pretend it's a first date, you know, when you're trying to impress him and make him think how cool you are. Try getting to know him again, and let him get to know you. Do this more than once. 

Each time does not have to lead to a state of the relationship talk, in fact, it's better if the first few don't. The goal should be not to resolve problems, but to just have a good conversation. After a little bit, he should come around to being able to work on the issues you guys have. 

Honestly, it sounds like therapy would benefit both of you, but therapy won't work for him if he's dragged into it. I'd suggest you go yourself so you can start to feel better about you. PPD is serious and shouldn't be ignored. That could be a time bomb that can come back and devastate you and your family if not properly treated. Take care of yourself if not for you, then for your child. I find cognitive / behavioral therapy to work better for me than traditional talk therapy, but YMMV.

In any case, good luck. You've got some hard work ahead of you, but trust me, the rewards for succeeding in such an effort should be well worth it. Keep us updated!",relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,2.0,

If you feel/felt strongly about continuing to be your child's voice/advocate until they grow older, then it would really be better to keep your parental rights legally by not placing your child for adoption.  If you're going through a rough patch, it's better to get temporary support without permanently relinquishing your rights to your child, which is what adoption is, even open adoption.

I understand if first parents were coerced or forced into giving up their child and that's a crappy situation to be in.  They didn't have a choice and their child was taken away.  But that's not the child's/adoptee's fault.

But if parents WANTED to remain as the parent/voice/advocate for their child during the childhood years, and CHOSE adoption, then they perhaps made a very unfortunate choice.  Also, not the child's/adoptee's fault.

If you were misled into making this unfortunate, permanent choice of wanting to guide your child's voice until later years, but instead had your child adopted, then I'm sorry others misled you.

I've poured the last 8 years of my life into VC's STL, do I count?

As I mentioned at CppCon 2014, licensing Dinkumware's STL in the mid-90s was an excellent decision. In addition to achieving C++98/03 conformance, this made it possible to pick up TR1 and C++11/14 years later.

&gt; The marketing never pointed out the HUGE disclaimer

On VCBlog, I [clearly said](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2011/09/12/10209291.aspx): ""In VC11, we intend to completely support the C++11 Standard Library, modulo not-yet-implemented compiler features.  (Additionally, VC11 won't completely implement the C99 Standard Library, which has been incorporated by reference into the C++11 Standard Library.  Note that VC10 and VC11 already have &lt;stdint.h&gt;.)""

I do agree that 2012 had a bunch of bugs, for several reasons. The biggest reason was the huge influx of new code (TR1 in 2008 SP1, lots of C++0x in 2010, atomics/multithreading in 2012). Compensating for missing compiler features was another source (e.g. variadic templates). Working Paper churn was also quite problematic (e.g. this led to weirdness in &lt;random&gt;). In 2013, [we fixed](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2013/06/28/c-11-14-stl-features-fixes-and-breaking-changes-in-vs-2013.aspx) many of these bugs (and switched to real variadic templates), and 2015 will contain [even more](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2014/06/06/c-14-stl-features-fixes-and-breaking-changes-in-visual-studio-14-ctp1.aspx) fixes. (I'll be writing another VCBlog post explaining the fixes between 2015 CTP1 and RTM.)

Also, since people always ask: 2013 shipped almost all of the C99 Standard Library, and 2015 is completing the missing pieces, modulo extremely minor omissions (I could look them up, but I'm on vacation; IIRC it's a couple of the FP macro things, and tgmath.h which is irrelevant to C++).",programming,t5_2fwo,6.0,

Okay, so she and I were attached at the hip, inseparable. We did everything together, it was awesome. However, her parents were going through a divorce and she stopped wanting to go home at night. Not a problem, I asked her to move in with me as I lived alone in a 2 bedroom apartment. She does, and for the first week it was awesome. Then she starts having her boyfriend over and having sex on EVERYTHING. I wasn't overly bothered until she stopped cleaning up after herself. She stopped cleaning, doing dishes, leaving her dirty laundry everywhere, and then she'd bitch to me about how gross my apartment was. After about 2 months I hit my breaking point. I walked into the bathroom and she had bled on everything. Seriously, menstrual blood on the toilet, on the floor, on the bathmat, all over the bathtub, on the shower curtain. Everywhere. I told her to clean it immediately as she wasn't a pig. She said that it wasn't her job to clean my apartment.

And it isn't proportional to road wear, because gas consumption is proportional to the weight of the vehicle (ignoring hybrids and electric vehicles) while road wear is proportional to the 4th power of the weight of the vehicle.

I hope to God someone is reading this, that someone else survived. This letter is my experience when the world ends. I hope this letter educated you on what has happened if you don't know the full story yourself.

I had been studying in China for my college language course, I thought it would be fun and I was only going to be studying there for 2 months. My host family consisted of a host mom and dad, and a sister. That particular day I was heading to the New Years celebration, which was a very big holiday in China. 

The celebration was fun, I separated from my host family and looked around on my own. There was a lot of drinking, a lot of dancing, and a lot of people. The celebration was probably the biggest one I had seen in my whole life. As I wandered through the celebrating hordes of people, the music changed to almost militaristic and a countdown began. I was sure it was only about 10 but I had a few drinks and went with it. 

The entire crowd was comparable to a mosh pit as the timer counted down from 60. People were throwing things into the air, pushing each other around, and generally acting barbaric. The behavior increased in craziness as the timer reached 0. As the timer stopped, the behavior changed from excited to rushed. 
A woman over a loud speaker addressed the crowd. ""Everyone, operation Yellowstone has been a success. Initiate lock down procedures."" 

My phone rang as everyone began leaving and running to their homes. I figured it was my host family telling me to go home, but it was my dad. Before I left, my dad and I had got into a fight with some choice words, and I hadn't talked to him since. When I answered I knew something was wrong.

My dad was panicked and was asking me if I was ok. I told him I was and asked him what was happening. I wish I had never asked that question, I wish I had never gotten that call. My dad told me what had happened. For some unknown reason their was a national emergency broadcasting through the United States. They broadcast announced Yellowstone had erupted for an unknown reason and told everyone to stay in there homes. 

As he explained he told me he heard something, my mom screamed and I received a dial tone. I tried calling back but I got no answer.

After the call the streets were no where near as crowded, still, some people running but most of the crowd gone. I saw an abandoned bike and took it to my host families house. Along the way I only saw people praying, homeless people scattered through streets and empty buildings, cars burning, and chaos from those out on the streets. I got to my host house and saw the family through the window, they were packing there things. I threw the bike away and ran inside. 

My host family had bags of things and were running downstairs. I followed without them knowing. I had been in the basement multiple times, but never saw what I saw then. They pulled over a couch to reveal a heavy metal door, my host dad pulled open the door to reveal a ladder. Before they went down I grabbed my host dads arm to stop him. He spoke barely any English, and was obviously not happy to see me. He told me to leave, get away, find somewhere else to hide. I refused to leave without answers. 

He then proceeded to pull a pocket knife from his pants pocket and lunged, his wife and daughter cowering away from us. He cut my arm, a light cut but painful. A pushed him back but he kept coming. I took a small glass vase and waited for him to lung again. As he charged with the knife I sidestepped and smashed the glass over his head. He crumpled to the ground. 

His wife and daughter were crying and cowering. I knew he would attack again when he woke up so I did the logical thing. I went down the ladder in the hatch, locking it shut as I descended. The descent took longer than I expected, and as I was going down all I heard was banging on the hatch door. I finally made it down to solid ground and was greeted by a big cache of food and water, beds, and little light. 

The room was about the size of a large bedroom, and was extremely dark.  I took in my surroundings and found a desk with a desk lamp. I turned it on to see a packet entitled ""The Yellowstone Protocol"". There wasn't much, but the text goes as follows.

""Congratulations, you have survived the eruption of the Yellowstone Super Volcano! The great Chinese empire has destroyed tyrannical America, and in 10 short years we will be the world power once again. All high ranking Chinese leaders are safe, as well as all tax paying, law-abiding citizens. You will have enough food for 3 people, so as long as you followed the one child law you will live happily and safe. In 10 years time a bell will go off to alert you it is finally safe to be above ground. Enjoy yourself, in a short while everything will be just fine.""

I write this to you for a couple reasons. The biggest being sheer boredom, considering I've been sitting down here for 10 years. However I also want to write this so if anyone finds this they can know what happened here. The bell went off weeks ago, yet I'm too afraid to go to the surface. However, by writing this I know that if I die out there, someone, someday, may find this letter.

Prey was much different to e.g. Half Life, where the protagonist is silent and thus has very little that a player can sympathise with.

My next would be Fallout 3. Rarely do I get so involved in a game that I end up playing it for more than an hour at a time.

Mechanic Feel: Melee Speed, both on the ground and in the air. (Wave Dashing, Light/Heavy Shielding, and Edge hogging would return, but instead of L-Canceling returning every character would have their landing lag for all of their aerials cut in half, simply to make the game more accessible. Also, Dash Dancing would be made very useful again, and finally characters would retain their ground momentum when they jump.)

New Gameplay Mechanic: Delta (Battlefield) versions of each stage.

New Game Mode: Story Mode. Each character would have their own story, and it would end with a fight against the final boss.

Removed Game Mode: Target Blast.

New Advanced Tech: Special Canceling. You can cancel your Special attacks by Jumping or Shielding. (On the ground only)

Removed Tech: Perfect Pivoting

Nintendo Newcomers: Isaac (Golden Sun), Starfy (The Legend of Starfy), Zael (The Last Story), Skull Kid (The Legend of Zelda), and Fiora (Xenoblade Chronicles)

3rd Party Newcomers: Lloyd Irving (Tales of Symphonia), and Zero (Mega Man)

2 Characters to be cut: Diddy Kong (I hate him both in Smash and out of Smash) and Dark Pit.

Returning Character: Solid Snake.

New Stage Gimmick: Certain Stages (Likely a Fire Emblem Stage) can be destroyed by certain factors, and you can make the stage itself grow smaller by destroying parts of the main platform itself.

4 new items: Companion orb (Similar to the assist trophy and Pokeball, but should a character pick it up a character specifically from their universe will spawn and help out for a bit.), Duplicate Cherry (Or whatever that item from Mario 3d World that creates a duplicate of the player character is called. Would give an Ice Climber effect), Blue Falcon (Summons F-Zero cars to run down the opponents), and a Chaos Emerald. (Freezes opponents in place for about 3 seconds)

See when you say shit like this, its pretty easy to tell that you have absolutely zero fucking clue on what the fuck you are talking about, and yet you act like Im the one that is being close minded. 

You are acting like we can just manipulate some variables in some way shape or form and come up with a way to travel faster than light. Go ahead and manipulate the equation x+y=z where x is 3 and y is 4, and come up with a variation where z is 9. No please, go ahead and try it. Because if you do, you single-handedly broke math and every single scientific result that we know of is no longer valid. 

So no, you can't just be REALLY clever and do some special math and come up with a way to travel faster than light.  

And for reference, Newtonian mechanics are an approximation of the relativistic mechanics for slow velocities.

I think Orbin is on the track.

From the video Description : ...And the series continues. Much like the ""Sinus"" playalong, I had a couple of days in between sessions to spend how I chose and figured I'd rehearse this bugger a few times. ""The Walk"" is the first Periphery tune I ever heard, learned/eventually 'Orbinated', and is one of two tunes with which I was requested to audition. Of course, this was back in the old days when Jake Veredika was the vocalist; this version was released after I had left and features the mighty Chris Barretto.

If I had to quantify, I'd estimate about 90% of these parts were composed between when I joined -- Sept '06 -- and 2007, with the remaining bits and some trimmings added sometime up until I embarked to record at Audio Hammer (that story is recounted in my ""Project 15"" video). Because of this, some of this stuff certainly feels stale and I'd probably do a few things differently.

 * could withstand higher G-forces than the manned aircraft, both in acceleration and manouvering    

 * could have a higher airspeed as they have a smaller cross-sectional area for their fuselage, thus reducing aerodynamic drag    

 * other factors limiting airspeed, such as heating from air friction would be less of a problem as the missile only has to last long enough to intercept its target

Furthermore, since the manned aircraft is being deployed into hostile territory it is possible that a dense air defence environment could launch missiles from two or more sites to surround an intruding aircraft, so that whatever direction the intruder took to evade a missile it would face another one.

A dense air defence system could include jamming to prevent the target detecting the approach of missiles.

Turning away from a missile approaching head-on at Mach 6+ will involve a turn with a large radius if the pilot is to avoid excessive G-forces, thus the missile could out-manouver it.

A nuclear-tipped missile such as the [Boeing Bomarc](http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/bomarc.htm) with its 10 kiloton warhead has a much larger kill radius than a conventional explosive/shrapnel missile, so it is not necessary to get closer than a couple of kilometers to make a kill.

Apart from being consistent with the existing behavior of typehints and being what the majority of the vocal community wants, it is also possible to reason about strict typehints statically.

This means that an IDE or other tool will be able to perform meaningful analysis based on typehinted functions. E.g. if you pass the result of a `string` function to an `int` parameter, your code is definitely wrong and you can be told so. Loose (casting) typehints do not offer this possibility, because a string can be or can not be a valid input to an int parameter depending on the exact value.

For the same reason loose typehints are also more fragile. Code that worked in casual testing during development will fail in production when unexpected, improperly validated user input is encountered. With strict typehints on the other hand it is very likely that code working with one input will also work with all other possible inputs, because the type check is not value-dependent.

The ability to statically check typehints is rather important to me. I think much of the usefulness of this feature would be lost without the ability to check correct usage with tooling.",PHP,t5_2qh38,36.0,

With the amount of energy my comments have generated inside of you, you could've gone and verified my recollections.



&gt;In reviewing the thread I see you responded with your obsession about rich white women having bareback sex due to free access to contraception.

That's a mischaracterization by you because we operate on different levels intellectually.  If one were to make an argument against a liberal policy, how would that be framed to be effective?  What do rich people, white people, and government being involved in peoples bedrooms tend to do to peanut-brained liberal foot soldiers?  So I crafted that argument as a form of argumentative Judo.   The bareback sex aspect was just to trivialize the mandate and boil it down to it's essence.  Easier to digest for the weak and small minded.  Clearly that high level of cerebralism was lost on you.


&gt; I don't know how women are protected from STD's by allowing men to not use a condom? I guess you think rich white women are not concerned with STD's?

If you're wearing a condom, you have no need for other forms of birth control.  Another simple truth seemingly lost on todays liberal youth who demand others sacrifice so they can get free sexual conveniences for their vaginas.


&gt;Your comparison of boat insurance to health insurance indicates a complete detachment from health issues. Obviously nobody knows when/if they will need medical care.

Firstly, review your statement.  You stated in the affirmative, if you knew you and yours didn't need a hospital stay, then you would gladly pay for yours and my families insurance.

If you knew you were never going to need a hospital stay, what would you be buying health insurance for?

Just as people without boats do not purchase boat insurance.  Further, the way you framed your  statement suggests some weird understandings about insurance.  What do you think the difference is between boat insurance and health insurance, other than the obvious?


&gt;Yes through the HARP program I have paid for people who either bought over priced homes they could not afford or used their homes as piggy banks when valuations were obviously crazy.

Weird comparison as HARP was a  safety net policy and free contraception is an entitlement.  Do you understand the difference between those two things?


&gt; If the question was not asked I don't know how it proves anything regarding cost being a factor for those questioned. We could say those who created the questions did not consider it to be a big factor.

Do you know how these types of studies are conducted?  Do you think the researchers at the CDC designed this decades long study with a fatal flaw and missed price?


&gt;You apparently feel entitled to complain without learning enough about the issueS (there are many and any solution will produce winners and losers)

What do you think I am ignorant of?  You're the one who thought free contraception for middle class and rich women was to solve the problem of unwanted pregnancies.  To whit, poor women who already have free contraception are the ones who have problems with it.


&gt;to even offer any type of solution.

Who would I offer it to?  What sort of outcome do you envision  that work would produce?

  
&gt; I am guessing you would be at the head of the line to then complain about government debt.

We're talking about the contraception mandate right?  How do you think people being forced to buy contraception insurance from private companies adds to the national debt in a manner to which I would go into a line to complain about?

&gt;I am guessing a small increase in unwanted pregnancies taken to term would add more to medical costs.

If I were to force people to act on behalf of others, I would prefer evidence to support that act.  Not guesses.  But that's just me.

I finish with a room and walk out, going down the hall to get to my next one. The guests come back and right away I hear them complaining about the heat in the room. Moments later the mom storms out and yells, ""Did you turn up the thermostat?""

Me, being rather meek, just quietly replied, ""It's policy.""

After high school we went our separate ways and went to different colleges and what not.  Jim stayed in our home town and went to a local college.  Rick moved out west to live with family and went to college out there.  I moved East and went to a college at the suggestion from a high school councilor.

Jim had trouble in college.  I have no real understanding of why but I think he just had a hard time sticking with it.  Eventually he finished I found out so good on him for that.

Rick followed in his dad's footsteps and pursued a career in the same field.  I still talk to Rick and we send each other gifts at Christmas and keep in touch with each other's family.

I went back to my home town a few years after I left just to see my folks and hang out with old friends.  Jim &amp; his friends wanted to go hang out at Walmart.  That was the nail in the coffin.  I was cool to go get some food or sit around and play video games.  But hanging out at Walmart was just not something I was interested in ever doing.  I knew at that point we had grown too far apart.  I don't recall when but at some point during those later years Jim got in my face about how I thought I was better than him.  That was hurtful honestly but I think he was lashing out at me for having escaped that little town.

I heard a while back that Jim had pursued a career with his dad and I was really honestly proud of that.  I hoped that he had done something good and found something he could be passionate about.  Then recently I found out he works at some department store.

I am not mad at Jim or anything.  He chose his path in life.  But I am not willing to be friends with someone who picks their path and then screams at me for doing something different.",AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1.0,

So, it might follow, that if the human history depicted in these records isn't really history, than God's involvement in human history--particularly the people of Israel--is called into question.

Yes and no.  It's certainly not a historical record in the modern, Western sense of ""history,"" but dismissing it as entirely fictional (or metaphorical) does call into question God's involvement with humanity.  That Paul presents the OT as ""written for our instruction"" does not mean it cannot be based in real events.  We learn from what those before us have done and we pass on our stories to others--but only certain, meaningful stories get passed on, rather than every last detail or event of our lives.

&gt;Is it not, rather, that whatever the historical veracity of the events depicted in the book of Job, the Christian is better, stronger, wiser, and more well-equipped for his journey with the real, historical Jesus Christ, the Son of God?

I'm not sure we can rightly draw a dichotomy between a metaphorical or fictional OT and a historical Christ.  The Bible certainly makes no such distinction within itself.  What does it mean to say Jesus Christ is ""the Son of God"" if that God has no history?",DebateAChristian,t5_2ryd5,1.0,

Buses in Glasgow are always late, definitely, but the cheap price makes up for it. A big reason why buses are expensive here in Sweden is because there is virtually no competition. Each ""province"" has a local bus service controlled by that province, so they can rack up the prices to their heart's content, while still being paid for by taxes. This can be seen as both positive or negative, e.g my local one decided to raise their ticket prices this year in order to afford refurbishing some stations and bus stops.

To be fair, it wasn't that hard a sell on my awesome hippie mom, but my dad wasn't at all reasonable and that's where the money came from. I would have got it (A Mooncup, actually, seems preferable, and the replacement in roughly ten years will be a MCUK) myself if I had a credit card and didn't find it insulting I have to pay for my necessities at 17. 

I was actually excited for my period. I'm using it right now, and it's fucking wonderful. It took me literally four hours to get it in the first time (I hadn't read the part about holding the fold *as low on the cup as possible*, and it kept popping open too soon), but I'm on the second day now and you can't feel it at all when you get it in right (admittedly I'm gonna need practice, there is *very* slight pressure when you do it wrong), no leaking (I slept naked last night! No diaper panties! No Japanese sheets! It was a fucking miracle!), and having a mL amount for just how little blood menstruation really is is really cool.

And not the 'you can't even feel a tampon!' lies. You really can't. And you really can feel confident you won't ruin your panties. Until you get it down pat, even the leaking is minimal, one of the liners you have left over will last the whole day.



And I've read everything I can on them, and they truly are safe if used with proper care- washing your hands, cleaning it, and leaving it in the cool carrying bag that nobody would be 'haha you're gonna put it in your *vagina* ha ha nasty' in public at a glance, unlike a pad or tampon. TSS, pad rash, heavier flow, exacerbated cramps, deposits and drying, none of that shit. And all you have to go through is a bit of frustration and blood at first if you're not a natural, like me.

I will bookmark this page and donate when I'm a real grown up with a job. 

I wish this would saturate pop culture already. Believe it or not, but I heard about this from Laci Green, had to do weird internet research to make sure it was legit and safe, and buy one at an overpriced health food store.

My siblings are weirdly critical and cynical about my menstrual cup journey, despite being raised by a hippie, somehow, and have made me feel ashamed and outcasted for my new change and  me trying to tell them about how cool it is. My little sisters' best friend, who I can say is generally a nice girl, vehemently told me not to dump it in the sink because 'I use that too', like it's any of her goddamn business what I do, and like it would affect her anyway. I can say fuck them and laugh, but I'm sorry to say some people *can't*.

Look at all the Crucible Faction vendors. See which have the weapons you like the most. Buy one of their Bonds, or whatever Titan's wear to gain rep.

Mostly, and before you grind any Faction's rep, get your Vanguard rep up to at least level 3. That's gonna take a while, but it will give you access to the Light level 33 gear, and the weapons as well. It's crucial.

The easiest way to get planetary materials is by trading in Crucible or Vanguard marks. 10 marks gets you 20 of whatever material, but this might not be feasible until you get better gear, You're gonna need those marks. Until you have the gear, google some videos on best farming runs on each planet, you can get a lot REAL fast with the right loop.

You can specify that you want to see a woman if that will make you more comfortable, and that's perfectly understandable. You won't be seeing a ""dirty old man"", you'll be likely seeing someone much like me. Let them know you've been sexually assaulted, and I promise they will have experience dealing with that. You can look up selfcare for vaginismus too. The pain is caused by an involuntary spasming of the muscles, so massage can really help. You don't have to have someone else do that. If you're using your hands you can use coconut oil, which feels nicer than lube. Try to relax the muscles without any penetration. If you get to the point of being able to insert a finger gently great, you can gently massage the muscles from inside as well. Don't focus on trying to insert anything though, just try to get things relaxed. You can also do kegels and as you let go of the contraction focus on actually letting the muscles you just tightened relax fully. Take a minute or two between contractions to see if you can let the muscles release any further. A physical therapist can teach you more exercises, and explain how to use dilators. There is options there besides having them even touch you if you're more comfortable not being touched by others. Just tell them what you are and aren't comfortable with, and work from there. 

I'm glad to hear that your partner isn't pushing you. Now take him at his word and stop pushing yourself to the point of tears! You want to be able to have a happy sex life, he wants to be able to have a happy sex life, and the route to that is patience and taking things at a pace that lets you learn how to enjoy sexual stuff without negative feelings. Focus on the stuff you can do and feel good about. You said you're okay doing pictures? Awesome, take some really great ones for him!

In the meantime please do look into that support group if counselling isn't an option. Many are moderated, and they will help steer you back to focusing on your own stuff. Let them know if that's something you need help with.

Please don't do this, see [Matthew Green's explanation of Zero Knowledge Proofs](http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/11/zero-knowledge-proofs-illustrated-primer.html). Here's an excerpt:

Hence it gets tacked onto all kinds of stuff -- like encryption systems and anonymity networks -- that really have nothing to do with true zero knowledge protocols.

I'd level your Vanguard up to at least rank 3 before anything else so that you will be able to buy the legendary armor and weapons with Vanguard Marks.  If you like playing the Crucible, you could level up your Crucible rep or any of the factions (which all take Crucible Marks), but it's definitely not something you need to be doing.  I'm level 31, about to hit 32, and I hardly ever play the Crucible.

2. No, I'd highly recommend getting Vanguards to rank 3 at least before doing any of the factions.  After that it's basically just personal preference.

3. The easiest way to get materials nowadays is to buy them from the Vanguard Quartermaster or Crucible Quartermaster.  They can be bought at a rate of 10 Vanguard / Crucible Marks for 20 materials.  If you want to save your marks for weapons and armor though, riding around in patrol is the other main way.  You can also occasionally obtain them from bounties or completing the Daily Heroic Story.  From the time the game came out until a couple weeks before the DLC, riding around in patrol was the only way to get materials at all, and the patch that introduced the other methods was a godsend.

Four years later though, I'm doing quite well. I've learned a *lot* of human relations skills, sales skills, mediation, psychology, meditation, and various more esoteric things. Done a *lot* of personal development courses. I now have a relatively high-level sales job and am considered by my colleagues to be extremely good at it. (My style mainly works off mediation.)

Back in those days, it took me something like a day of playing to complete my first successful flight from lave to another system, including docking.  But once I did it once, then it started getting *a lot* easier.   But you had to work to earn that sense of accomplishment.  It was *hard*, and so you really earned the satisfaction of even that simple achievement.  

And at that point, a whole galaxy...eight of them, actually...opened up before me.   And I was hooked;  I didn't stop until I made *ELITE*.    I was a bounty hunter, a smuggler, a pirate, a pawn and a theif, and occasionally even an honest trader.  I would do the Reidquat run as a warm-up, and then look for a *really* dangerous system to hunt in.  Basically, I practiced until I was actually good at it, instead of quitting just because some feel-good sense of 'winning' wasn't handed to me on a platter like games of today do.  

Back then games required real skill, and if you couldn't cut it, you lost the game, period.    And a little imagination helped, too; wireframe, or simple solid-colour polygons give you a canvas, and your mind had to fill in the details.   That is not really encouraged as much in the big games of today.   

And for God's sake, if I see another post about how Elite is bad and should be more like WoW or Eve, I am just going to have to murder someone.   IF you think either of those things, it simply isn't the game for you, you know?   

I wonder if any  other old-timers are kicking it in Bebece these days?  Is that system even in ED?  I guess I'll have to take a look.

I could see us getting married and having babies, which was totally unlike me to get so sappy. 

We broke up a couple months later. 

Then we got back together the next year after chatting online again. We started dating again the summer after I finished grade 10. We got married last year and I'm pregnant with our second baby due next spring. We just celebrated our one year wedding anniversary on the same day as our 10-year dating anniversary this past summer.

If he doesn't want to be part of the show, then the BBC should retcon him out of it. have a multi Doctor story where Capaldi goers back and keeps Hurt from regenerating at the end of DoTD. Hurt would then be THE 9th Doctor and go on to meet Rose and they could show scenes of Hurt being the Doctor in the stories of season 1. 

The story would end with Hurt regenerating into Tennant. Capaldi would then realize that the change in his timeline makes him the 12th regeneration with none left. So this sets in place the quest for Gallifrey and a new life cycle.",doctorwho,t5_2qhek,-4.0,

Nothing turns non-vapers off quicker than the assholes who stick out their chest and go on a furious rant about ""It's not smoking and there's no laws saying I can't vape here!"". I've only been vaping for about a month now (smoked for 32 years) and have already had an unpleasant experience with two of this type of self righteous douchenozzle. If you're a former smoker don't vape where you wouldn't smoke. Easy as that.

I've been lucky so far. The 3 B&amp;M and online vendors that I have purchased from are quite knowledgeable and know their business. I wholeheartedly agree with the view that a B&amp;M that sells bongs and hookah right alongside their vaping equipment gets a pass from me.

It's an odd thing to do in Florida, but I wouldn't have even noticed had the man who lived there not been completely insane. Standing outside talking at a normal volume on a Saturday afternoon? Called the cops to complain about noise. Closed our wrought iron gate when we got home from work? Called the cops again. Barbecue in the mid afternoon on a holiday? Yep, cops again. That time he told the police that responded that he was pretty sure my husband was an illegal alien. They laughed. I had tried going over and talking to him, but there was absolutely no way this man could live around other people. He called the cops once because I walked across the carport in high heels. The police eventually stopped responding, and that was the point where he completely blew a gasket. 

I was sitting on the patio while my dogs wandered around the yard, and suddenly he comes storming out of his house screaming ""Put the fucking dogs inside! I'm so fucking sick of this!"" over and over. I was surprised, even having experienced how insane this guy was before, and told him that the dogs weren't barking, and I didn't understand why he was upset. He started shouting that their tags are jingling, and their nails clicked on the concrete and then screamed over and over, ""It isn't fucking fun living here,"" punching a palm tree, and grabbed and started shaking my fence. That time *I* called the police. 

We moved shortly after that, largely because it was almost impossible to live there and enjoy our (beautiful) backyard without him going ballistic, and I was afraid of how far it would escalate after seeing him beat the shit out of a *tree*. Our landlord called us a couple months later to make a statement about his behavior. They apparently had to sue the guy because he started harassing the next tenants the same way, and they said that they couldn't live there like that, forfeited their deposit, and left, leaving the house vacant.

That doesn't answer the question. Do you think that future law should be able to prosecute what previous law allowed?

&gt;And I'm not sure what you mean about ""now"". Lobbys have existed for decades (maybe centuries) to try and weaken/crumble the 1st and 2nd amendment.

That doesn't answer my question. You're talking about a political slippery slope. Do you think this political slippery slope has begun with the ban of child porn? Has it begun at some point afterwards, so certain child porn should be illegal; but other that is banned now is already part of that slippery slope? Will it begin just now? Why?

Anyone with even a basic understanding of how ISP routing in this country works can see this. Unless the west coast and east coast have suddenly become further apart, the path your packets are taking to reach their destination is to blame.
  
East Coast is seeing increased ping time and packet loss because TWC/Verizon/Whoever are playing the same blackmail games they played with Netflix. They are intentionally routing your traffic through longer paths until Riot choses to pay them for a direct ""prime"" route.  
  
So instead of practicing pointless upvote activism, call your Congressman and express your frustration. Make it clear you support Net Neutrality. Call your ISP and complain. Basically, do *anything* except what you're doing now.

From wikipedia:
&gt;Copyright is a legal right created by the law of a country, that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to its use and distribution, usually for a limited time, with the intention of enabling the creator (e.g. the photographer of a photograph or the author of a book) to *receive compensation for their intellectual effort.*",books,t5_2qh4i,8.0,

A Missouri state senator claims that [requiring a spouse/father's permission to get an abortion should be constitutional because that spouse will eventually be forced to pay child support](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/12/republican-wants-women-get-permission-father-having-abortion). Essentially, he believes that one person's bodily autonomy ends where another's financial rights begin.

&gt;Asked about Casey v. Planned Parenthood, a 1992 Supreme Court decision striking down a requirement that a woman inform her husband if she haves an abortion, Brattin says he doesn't believe the ruling affects his bill. Because Missouri has laws requiring men to pay child support during a pregnancy, he contends, a bill requiring a man's involvement in an abortion should be constitutional.

Suppose that the U.S. gets a right-leaning court after 2016, and that argument (your rights end where my rights begin) holds up constitutionally. Suppose that the U.S. Supreme Court did rule that government-enforced compulsory child support ended the argument that abortion was nothing more than an exercise in self-autonomy.

Would you support legal paternity surrender then?",changemyview,t5_2w2s8,5.0,

EDIT: If your budget stretches, get the Asus X99 Deluxe. The built in wifi and Bluetooth is apparently Broadcom based and works in OSX.  I couldn't find any info on it at the time and figured I could add wifi and Bluetooth via an add in card pretty simply. Of course just after I'd ordered my parts the news came in..

I used a combination of two guides to get things setup. The first part of this guide

Boot flags needed for everything until you have the Nvidia drivers are ""npci=0x2000 kext-dev-mode=1 nv_disable=1"". Boot flags after the Nvidia web drivers are installed are ""npci=0x2000 kext-dev-mode=1 nvda_drv=1""

* The Instalment Title: 5uper 5mash bros: 5on of 5uper 5mash

* Mechanics Feels: Like Melee dammit!

* One new gameplay mechanic: Aerial Collisions - Bodyblock foes trying to return to stage. Using a grab in midair makes your character a dead weight blocking your opponent's recovery.

* Goodbye to Classic mode entirely, because it's not even classic anymore.

* Instead, say hello to Super Smash Mode, it's like classic but with always-on online interactions. Will your next match be a minigame, computer players, or another human? Who Knows? How Exciting!

* One new exploitable glitch advanced tech: Ledge-state extension - make the game think you are on the ledge for as long as you remain airborne off the ledge. How do you do this and how does it help the game? Who knows? it's emergent gameplay. I'd say just put L-canceling back, but that's not ""New""

* Remove One exploitable glitch advanced tech: Umm, all the things I would have said were fixed from 3ds to wii U. So I guess even less dash-dancing? Pivots seems sorta intentional, really.

* new Nintendo fighters: Some new 9th gen pokemon (probably the fire/fighting starter), the default protagonist from Mother 4: Mother Online Reborn [Japan release only], Adam Malkovich from Metroid: Other M, Mii Ninja and Mii Superhero

* 2 new 3rd-Party: Raz from Psychonaughts and The Kid from Bastion. Nintendo finally has cared about indie devs in the next 10 imaginary years.

* 2 characters from previous titles need to be removed: Dark Pit obviously shouldn't be in the game, but he stays around as an assist trophy to keep Shadow company. Dr. Mario went 5 feet off stage and fell, he's now 5 feet under.

* One returning cut veteran: Wolf. Now not even sort-of a clone, but with an even worse VA than Fox.

* One brand new stage gimmick to be used: Damaging/healing environment - In the Metroid Prime: Echoes stage set on Aether, you are slowly healed in the light beacons and hurt outside the when the stage transforms to Dark Aether. [Dark Aether is also the final smash of Dark Ike. Please, understand]

* 4 new items: Rock, Paper, and Scizzors. The classic game comes to Smash Bros. The proper tool is a OHKO on opponents. (rock beats scizzors, etc) Also, Dummy Smash Balls. They look real, but they explode in your face when you break them (like how lightning and timers can backfire)

* 4 cut items: No more Gust Bellows, grass (why is that a thing anyway?) Beetles or Drills.

* One new final boss: **Reggie**",smashbros,t5_2qiep,4.0,

It outright says ""would that be important?"" and I say ""yes, in many or even most cases it is"". As a counterpoint, though, *you're* extrapolating quite a bit. I don't sit down with the intent of deciding what the author is not being inclusive of, but I am acutely aware of things. Precisely because I'm *not* in a position to take it for granted, which is due to my own identifiers and variables.

Your assumptions aside--which is ironic when trying to call me out on extrapolation--my point is *not* that I should be catered to. My point is that gender is one of many things that *does* define who we are. And the further away from ""White, straight, cisgender, male"" you are, the more those identifiers define you. It's not about catering to people who aren't white, straight, cisgender or male, though. It's about the fact that

&gt;I write women as if they were men

Is poor advice. And to act like gender has no impression on who you are is foolish. Actually, I'm gonna cut the diplomacy: Acting like someone's gender doesn't matter is fucking bullshit and anyone who's interacted with other human beings should know better. For fucks sake, we wouldn't even be having this conversation if gender didn't matter.

And cut the ""you're just too much of an activist"" bullshit. I'm sorry, that's a terrible fucking argument to make in the first place, especially when it's not relevant here. I mean, again, you're making my point. People wouldn't have to be activists if this shit didn't matter, so *clearly it does*. Do you know what it's like to realize that people don't think you exist? To read a book and go ""hey, guess people like me can't be heroes"". Why the fuck do you think well written female fantasy characters are such a Big Deal in the first place? You wanna know what's tiring? Going to your escapism place and realizing that just like in the real world you're the butt of a joke. You think I like watching fucking *Men in Black III* and there's a throwaway joke where a runway model says ""hey"" with a deep voice? For fucks sake, try putting yourself in someone else's shoes. Imagine ""if I had to put up with this bullshit every single fucking day"" would I be so ready to brush it off?

That is, again, a digression, though, because my point, that you so clearly missed, is that gender has a fucking impact on who we are as people, because *it clearly matters to the world writ large*. If gender wasn't an important part of who we are, Robin Hobb wouldn't have wrote that post. If gender wasn't important to who we are, the post she read that made her want to write that wouldn't have existed.

Yes, in a vacuum, ""is gender important to who you are?"" wouldn't be a yes. But we don't live in a fucking vacuum. Vasquez from *Alien* was a part written for a man. It would also be a *completely different character* if it was played by a man. There would not be a fucking TVTrope [about the fact that strong female characters dying named after her](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VasquezAlwaysDies). And it pisses me off that this is a conversation that keeps coming up and people keep asking ""does this matter?"" Of course it fucking matters or it wouldn't keep coming up.

This isn't an activist thing. Among activist circles I'm considered a fucking troll. This is common fucking sense Jesus fucking Christ I would have expected one of the most respected female fantasy authors to realize that her gender is pretty fucking important to her story because her own story would be completely different if she was a man.",Fantasy,t5_2qknd,6.0,

A Google search yields the class documentation as the first result, followed by the release notes and WWDC sessions that described it in detail.

It would be hard to judge exactly what would count as ""using all of one's capacity to help others""--as you said, one might think that we would have to limit ourselves to fulfillment of our most basic needs in order to be worthy of praise for any charitable actions, which intuitively seems wrong.  

I think that it is important to recognize the difference in my capacity and  your capacity for assisting the impoverished (etc) compared to the capacity of someone like Gill Bates.  You correctly point out that there is almost certainly more that you and I could be doing.  But there is no doubt in anyone's mind that you and I do not have anywhere near the capacity to make a significant dent in, for example, world hunger.  And if we wanted to try anyway, we would likely have to limit ourselves to bare necessities.  People like Gill Bates, however, have that capacity, and they can do it while continuing to live a more comfortable life than nearly anyone else on the planet.  So I think that the issue has a lot to do with the excess wealth specifically.  But I would be willing to accept that people like you and I are blameworthy to some extent for not doing more--e.g., for not donating more to charity.  However, it would be to a lesser extent than someone like Gill Bates, since Gill Bates's capacity greatly surpasses ours. 

Edit: replied before seeing your edit 

Edit 2 (after having read your edit, and the NYT article):

I'm inclined to think that the article is right for the most part.  People ought to do more than they are doing.  At the end, they suggested that a person making $50000 has the same obligation as a person making $100000.  They didn't say anything about people making $1-million or $100-million, but presumably they would say that they all should be as close to $30000 as possible.  It seems like it would fit well with that thought, though, that people making $100-million deserve more blame for not limiting themselves to $30000 than people making $50000 do, just in virtue of how much they are missing the target by.  If Person_A makes $1-million each year, and Person_B makes $50000, even if Person_A donates $500000 each year, and Person_B donates $0, Person_A is still missing the target by significantly more than Person_B.

I have a question for you, though.  Why should charitable contributions not be something we consider when evaluating whether or not a person if worthy of praise or of blame?  In what sense are charitable contributions different from that beach scenario? ",philosophy,t5_2qh5b,1.0,

He gained unauthorized access to a system and defaced a web site. On the surface, that looks like nothing more than spray painting a UGA sign or something. But the response to this incident will consume significant man hours. That server can't ever be trusted again, so it will have to be rebuilt.

If the systems he touched contained SSNs, then UGA is liable for any identity theft that could occur to the victims (even if they can't directly tie it to this incident).

A quality power supply will have a number of protection circuits built in, including input and output protection on each rail.

The GTX 970 will provide bunches of performance &amp; play all of today's games on their [high settings](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-gtx-980-970-maxwell,3941-10.html). 

I don't see any obvious bottlenecks (and for $800, you shouldn't), but if I were to peer into a crystal ball to foresee what you might upgrade first, I'd consider the following:

1) *Will your computing needs change over time?*

If you're mining bitcoins, editing 4K video, doing 3D graphics rendering, or anything CPU/GPU intensive, then sure, you're going to need better parts over time. Your hardware may have to evolve with you.

But 99% of the population don't need that kind of horsepower. If you're playing games, listening to music, using office applications (Microsoft Word, Excel), browsing the internet, editing home video for Youtube, etc. then this computer will last you 4-5 years, no problem.

*2) How quickly will this technology become obsolete?*

I remember when upgrading from a 486 to my first Pentium machine, and it was such a dramatic change. For once. My computer didn't take 5 minutes to load. I felt like I could do anything! But since then, each subsequent generation has ""felt"" less dramatic. 5 years ago, we were introduced to the first-generation Core chips (I believe it was the i7), and many of those machines are still capable of meeting most computing needs today. Why? Because in today's world, software demands less and less from its hardware. Much of the software we use is in the cloud (i.e., GMail, Youtube, etc) and does not ask THAT much of your computer. I don't see that trend changing. Even today, there are few games that utilize [more than 2 threads](http://www.gamedev.net/topic/627258-how-many-average-number-of-threads-does-a-game-needs-regardless-of-simplicity/). Software developers have to think about the ""average PC"", and build games that can be run on Core i7's + SLI cards as well as Core i3's + Geforce 750's. That is also the reason why PC builders will rarely recommend a CPU better than a Core i5 for a build under $1,000.

*3) But what about new technology that already know about today?*

Off the top of my head, 4K is probably your biggest concern. But, it'll take its sweet time in getting here, and when it does, you'll probably want a stronger rig to handle the additional processing. But we just finished getting everyone to HD/1080. I don't think the *mainstream* demand is quite there for 4K. I don't want one. I live in San Francisco, and I don't even know anyone who owns a 4K TV. Even then, this computer can run 4K games *today* (just not on the highest settings). It's one of those things on the horizon to keep an eye on, and I'll jump on that when the time comes. I just don't think that'll be any sooner than 2016.

tl;dr Probably your RAM (jumping up to 16GB) or your SSD (jumping up to 480 GB/1TB). Over the long-run, you could probably get away with a new video card without upgrading any of the other components to give your machine another couple years of life.",buildapcforme,t5_2tjcr,2.0,

The characters were mostly very fun and their interactions engaging, and the story had a solid premise being delivered by a worthy first half-hour (or so). I'd thought that with the solid pacing, good humour and sharp attention to detail, it could only get better, but unfortunately it kind of eases off on the pedal at the wrong time. Take the ""old-robot"" scene as an example - I don't remember coming out of that fifteen minute section with any emotional or thought-provoking response. It was just... filler. In a movie. And I'm pretty sure that's a relic of *Eve no Jikan*'s time as an ONA series. Which, if they'd trimmed down to fit the tone of the earlier parts of the movies and focused on creating a complete world, could have been much better.

I'm not going to suggest a replacement Number 2 - not until I've seen all of these movies myself - but I can say that just this past week I've seen more than one Miyazaki movie that delivered far better than *Time of Eve* did. Not that the latter fails; quite the contrary. Like you said in the imgur album, it wholly delves into the characters' actions and beliefs in this similar yet distant world, and in one of the most captivating, enchanting, atmospheric locations I've seen in animation yet - that memorable and *awesome* café.

Glorious **pro shots of LA, Lady Gaga, Heavy Montreal, encore NY, and London**. The Lady Gaga shots were decent, but the LA &amp; NY shows were Legend 1999 quality. But boy, the proshot of London was amazing. Sweeping crane cameras showing Yui waving the flag, shots from the crowd, capturing crowd surfers and the excitement.

&gt;In all honesty if the show ended there I would have been happy.

Well lo and behold every morning the issue wasn't there because people have left for work so the network wasn't taxed anymore so nothing was done.

There is an ISP in Texas that offers amazing speeds for a ludicrously high price that people paid for because they're the only ISP in miles and they only offer expensive packages.  What the ISP didn't tell their customers is they had a 25 GB data cap and the moment they broke it they got reduced down to dial-up speeds.  Most people would blow through the cap in the first week of the month and so they'd call daily talking about their speeds being knocked to shit.  All we could do, due to the data usage, would be to refer them to their local office who would in turn hang up on the customer and redirect them back to us.

Probably my favorite one was an ISP in... the midwest somewhere.  They sold ""blazing fast"" internet at 50 Mbs down but in actuality the package was a grand 1.5 Mbs down for $100ish a month.  Their nodes were so terrible that looking at them hard could make them knock hundreds of people offline.  Their technicians were so bad they often  hooked to the wrong repeater (I have NO idea how) causing even more issues and if by some miracle the customer actually got online they had a 25 Mbs, yes... 25 megabyte, data cap before they were knocked down to dial-ups.  My companies policy for them was to exclusively refer customers to the local office who in turn never answered.

Here are some questions you should ask.

1) Are you trying to scam people?

2) Are you deceptive or dishonest in any way when selling your idea?

4) Do you have a plan on how you are going to spend the funds?

5) Do you have a prototype that properly demonstrates that your idea is feasible, or a well elaborated and supported theoretical basis for your idea?

6) Are your rewards realistic and fair? Will they justify people supporting your project?

7) Do you have a well thought out timeline for your project?

8) Have you properly considered the risks of your project, and listed ways to mitigate those risks?

So then they fight the French some more, and then they fight the Americans some more, and at some point human nature is what it is. It's not an argument against anything. It's what happens when people are too far gone. 

Post-colonial Taiwan was barely a thing, before it turned into the safe haven for the KMT. I wouldn't consider the KMT as an entity to have ever really been a ""good thing"", and I don't know how much better China would have been had they won the civil war. South Korea was run by an authoritarian dictatorship for quite some time before becoming what it is today. Nowhere near as bad as the North, but still not pretty. Both of those were also under more-or-less military control, on behalf of the democratic powers during the Cold War.

Essentially, what Olson discovered and published in his article was not the legal definition of CP, so mod volunteers couldn't really do anything about it without a report to stand on (this is standard practice for 8chan; they'll only delete boards once they've got users complaining or reporting the board in masses). If they were going to delete it, they needed a report to justify deletion of the content.

If Olson wanted this disturbing (but sadly legal) content deleted, he needed to report it or write to an admin about it. Otherwise, the mods cannot do anything to delete it without compromising one of the major ideas which created 8chan: People can post whatever they want, as long as it isn't illegal.

However, I'm not too clear on the subject, so I'll send an email to hotwheels asking the following questions:

- When the posts were deleted.

- What boards they were on.

- Whether there were any reports on the content Olson published.

- Whether the mods had the ground to delete the content without reports.

I'll be back soon with the answers.

I think it's all about expectations with that show. It has a lot of main characters, and it splits its time up among them pretty close to equally. So the show is ultimately going to spend a lot of time on the characters you just don't care about. For example I liked Izaya a lot, but were just horrendously bored whenever Celty or Semyon was the focus. Which was probably the reason I just fell off the first 2 times since I weren't expecting them to take up so much of the screan time.

Just going in to it knowing that though I think makes all the difference. Sticking with it past the introductory stage you start to see how all the stories just start to play off one another and intertwine, which is going to make the parts with the boring characters a lot better because they start to involve and affect a lot of the characters you actually do care about.

Crossing a sub over at 120hz is the worst thing anyone can do. 80hz honestly is the max you want to go. The higher the frequencies from a single sub the more localized it will be. Also you will get much less deep bass. It will be all mid to high bass. And for $500 are you kidding and you need an amp? Save your money. 

Why do you want passive speakers? For a nearfield system, especially with a computer, the studio monitor will be king. 

Look at Emotiva Airmotiv 5S (what I use), Adam A5x, JBL LSR 305. As for a subwoofer look at SVS Sb1000, it has bass management built in, or some studio subwoofers like a Presonus T10 (what I use) which has a very robust bass management system. ",audiophile,t5_2qmiy,1.0,

This entire year is memorable for me because each day was so different. Sitting here thinking about it, I decided to run some numbers on my travel this year. I thought you might find this interesting, I did:

Miles Traveled by Bus in Latin America: 13,694

Miles Hitch-hiked in Latin America: 1,128

Hours on planes: 25

Miles traveled by bus in USA: 1134

Miles traveled by car in USA: 780

Days spent traveling by boat: 11

Days spent out of the country: 278

New countries visited: 10

The whole thing was an incredible experience, absolutely unforgettable. What really made it were all the great people I was able to share it with. You know who you are. Thank you all very much. I can only hope for more years like this in my future. I feel blessed.

If I learned anything from this experience it's that life is meant to be enjoyed no matter where you are or what your situation is. Some parts of the trip were a struggle but totally worth it for the overall experience. There is always something positive you can focus on and celebrate. If you have a crazy dream, I say: Go for it. life is too short :)

I would suggest wearing 2 pairs of thick socks on your feet, blow drying the inside/outside of one boot for two minutes, then stick your foot in it. Do the same to the other boot. Make sure to heat the back of your foot (achilles tendon area) and toes, especially. Walk around with them around your house. Repeat the heating process every 40-60 mins for as many hours as you like. Do this for many, many days, until the boots feel comfortable to wear without the thick socks, etc. Basically the leather is SUPER stiff and you need to soften it by wearing the heck out of your boots. These boots last such a long time and honestly I think they are an amazing price for how long they last (my friend has had hers for 6 years and you cannot tell them apart from my two year olds!).

f46396a3065140c266e3a3bedac767d5,f46396a3065140c266e3a3bedac767d5,"If you're not reading my comments, then you obviously have forfeited your right to make a legitimate criticism of what I'm saying, not that you could come up with one it seems. Still, for this comment I'll drop the directs quotations of your post just so you'll at least *read* it, and to give you a break from being made to look a complete idiot quite as much as you have previously.

I'm not believing historians without question, because I've actually studied the topic a bit, wrote on it, disagreed with some and agreed with others, and don't believe in the ludicrous shit you do. My prose isn't bad, trust me, I just like breaking down lengthy crap comments like yours on reddit into small sections because its convenient. By the way your wording is terrible by your own admission and you spell poorly, so if you really want to nitpick about writing style, I'd suggest you do it to someone that is as thick as you are.

I don't sound like an emotionally immature 14 year old, however the comments you make do make you sound like an utterly uninformed Nazi apologist. The assumptions I'm making are not random, they are weighed up judgements about your character based on what you actually *say*. You're completely averting the fact that the stabbed in the back idea is a myth. Benjamin Freeman was an anti-Semitic lobbyist, the fact that you're referencing him tells me a lot about your own beliefs. Either way, the US joined the war for a few reasons. If you're going to blame it on the Jews, at least be honest about it.

Your rant about talking in prose is funny, particularly when you start it out by saying ""You're prose"". I'm not talking to my own argument, I'm talking to you; but with the format we are using I'm trying to address specific parts of your comment in an appropriate manner. I'd rather do that, especially when pointing out the specific errors of your horrid argument, rather than do a lengthy prose piece that I don't need to. 

You're also criticising me for making assumptions when many of those assumptions are completely valid and when you make assumptions yourself (That I am not learned on this subject, or that you know your material and stuff like what semantics means, when you obviously don't). I'm blaming you for what you have said here, in this discussion, and what you have implied. If you're going to repeat the same lingo used by people like Stormfront users then you should expect to be subject to similar criticism. What you said about the burden of proof is similarly whiny nonsense that boils down to this; your feelings are hurt because I've called you out on being blatantly wrong about history. Good to know. You don't understand how burden of proof works anyway.

I'm not making your comments into a multi-comment of some sort either, I'm just addressing individual parts of your comment in more detail. I'm not writing you a prose essay when there is fundamentally no need to do so. I wouldn't write prose in this manner normally and that should be obvious, but you are just desperate now in looking for ways to criticise me because I've called out your argument. The fact of the matter is that this is not a real life conversation or one over the phone; it is a conversation by text communication on an internet content aggregator comments section. Ignoring whole comments because they actually try to add context to their criticism and debunk you in detail is really just an admission that you lack the intellectual capacity to make an argument.

All you're doing I'm afraid is whining. Whining that I'm not treating you with the same legitimacy that I would ascribe to someone who doesn't believe in complete bullshit. You don't owe me evidence or explanation, of course you don't, but I don't owe you the etiquette of a polite academic historical debate when you are completely blind to historical evidence and cite the same evidence and turns of phrase of Holocaust deniers. You've insulted me a number of times which makes you quite the hypocrite and I'm the one who has actually focused on the subject matter. You've just been talking about imaginary rules of etiquette for this sort of conversation and avoiding the topic for several posts.

I'm not going to ""fix my tone"" because some hack like you tells me to, sorry buddy. The reason I'm convinced that I can't learn anything from you is because you're wrong and nobody with any credibility with regards to the field of history agrees with you. When you're done complaining, avoiding the subject (I'm the one staying on topic), avoiding criticism and avoiding making any sort of argument, and disregarding etiquette yourself, then I'll have a more civilised conversation with you. Until then you're literally just another nutter on the internet.

While I don't explicitly doubt that he found some sort of tablets, they certainly weren't made of gold. Also, the where. I don't think that hillside, although the location in Western New York he alleged is so far fetched. More likely stolen from a Masonic Temple, though. 

*enter conspiracy time* 

When JS found out about the plates during a meeting at the temple, as he and his kin were members, he made it his goal to free them. They are the story of the bible on the North American continent from 12,000 years ago.(I suspect, since I figure that's how old the actual bible story is, and it was just chopped down and mangled over time. It being representative of ideals of another earlier time, from another time before...). When he found them they had script similar to Elder Futhark and Aramaic and [Ge'ez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%27ez_language).

 Since it had similarities to EF, which is the newest of the three, you can figure a clever lad with a ""seer stone"" could figure it out. Since he was in New York, and since there is little elaboration on his actual acquisition of his stone, I'll figure it was a circular template with either Ge'ez or Aramaic written language from some exhibition nearby. 

Now, I mentioned Aramaic, and it's probably a language you know of. I doubt you know what Ge'ez(pronounced how it looks) is. It is the language of the Eritrean people. Among them number [Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrean_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church)(I can't help but wonder if that doesn't reference [Tiw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BDr) from another culture. Or [Tiwanaku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwanaku), all ancient. What if we weren't separated by time like we think. Advanced as the Romans in the jungles of South America, the Aztecs stomped through the underbrush until they were destroyed by disease.

 Super-bug strains of the flu, Typhus could easily decimate a population if they weren't expecting it. I imagine it happens every once in a while, die-offs. Then whomever is left resumes caveman like. Well, forest and such dweller. The CDC just said that the [flu levels](http://www.wunderground.com/maps/health/) are at epidemic numbers, and we have medicine. 

TL;DR: It may be odd sounding, however how do you know better? I grew up LDS and it makes some sense. Do you realize that [Nebiru](so called Planet X, the 10th, maybe 11th) is referenced by the Mormon [Kolob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolob)?

My favorite heroes are Drow Ranger, Windrunner, QoP, OD, PA, Lina, Bounty, and Luna.

But everyone reads genre fiction, so it's much easier to get worthwhile feedback, even if it's just a personal opinion.


It's interesting that you brought this up, because I noticed that there's a substantial amount of animosity towards literary fiction / MFA writers here (even more-so in /r/writing), and that people conflate MFA work with ""cookie-cutter narratives"" and ""purple prose"", when in fact –and just look at recent graduates from the Iowa Writer's Workshop– many of the best (and most original) writers today have gone through the MFA system. 

It's upsetting to see the general ignorance in this sub (and of course, the internet as a whole —this is already a very well-maintained garden), especially when novice-level attempts at literary fiction are met with half-serious ""oh you must be in an MFA program"" comments. And then! To think that these same commenters have only published KDP Singles, if at all —and have yet to attract an agent, or complete a book / movie deal with a publishing house, or have their work looked at by a professional editor, or win a single grant, honor, or award for their writing (NONE of which requires that you 1) possess an MFA, and/or 2) write literary fiction). It's enough to give the literary fiction writers on this sub a persecution complex. 

This is primarily why I was speculating about the possibility of a smaller, more focused sub. There has to be at least ~20 of us out of the 4000 here right?

She introduced me to my first group of friends as well as becoming my first best friend in high school. I had a crush on her as well but due to my insecurities and fears it prevented me from expressing my emotions and desires to be more than friends. I was alright with it for a long time and we eventually just stayed as good friends for a while. 6 years later and after me undergoing my process recovery I come to find out that she isn't the person that I had previously put in my head that was.(reason I put this in here is because while in recovery,I have been able to find more about myself and why I chose to have this girl in my life) little by little my interest for keeping the friendship starts to diminish as I know that my desired to be more than friends would not be met as well as that the more that I have matured in certain characteristics of my life she had still a little ways to go which In reality I could care less because its her life but when she is constantly complaining and bitching about everything and I try to guide her or help her find the answers to her problem she just chooses to ignore them and keep falling into the same cycle over again. Then in one camping trip with her and my other best friend she decides to be a complete cunt to me due to an argument I had with my other friend and just completely disregards everything I say and acts as if I didnt exist. What hurt is when I went to go lie down next to her at night without any sexual intentions behind it I just wanted to say hi and how are you enjoying the trip and then she goes on to tell to go away the second I lie down next to her. To top it off she tries to hide my cigarettes on the ride back saying that's disgusting to smoke even though she ducking smoked the whole weekend you bitch. God and I even let her know that they need to help clean my moms van when we get back after trashing it and the second we get back they drive away leaving me to clean that shit up.

The irony in this statement is astounding. You make a post about how Rabia (who is most certainly biased) and SK (who is less biased but still admits she has been influenced by Adnan's personality) are biased and then you call Jay brave and grown up for ""confessing by telling the truth to get it off his chest""???!!! The police went to Jay, not the other way around. If he gave one care in the world about Hae's friends or family then why the fuck did he not tell the police he saw her dead body and helped bury it at any point in the month after her disappearance?!? There's bravery, and then there's ""plea deal to get you off the hook on an accessory to murder charge.""

It's clearly a broader trend, and an extension of internet culture that's been brewing for years. Some of us use the internet differently from others, but SJWs in particular want to dictate how others use *their* portions. 

And a big part of that is we had a society online where status was practically non-existent. Where it did exist was via merit. You could earn trust by acting responsibly. You didn't need to have your real name attached to a website to want it to run well. The sites that cared for users the most succeeded.

The more people got used to attaching their real identity online, the more they felt under fire. The internet can be a hostile place. Instead of embracing it, or building a wall and enclosing themselves, they chose to try and change everyone else's behavior. They're basically wading into battle and then crying about being shot at, all the while they're firing back.

There's always been crybabies online. The difference is, we used to tell them to join the subculture or find a group they got along with better. And it worked. Now it's ""you can't say that, you can't do that, you can't tell me I'm not in your club, and once I'm in by self-declaration I expect you to meet my needs"". It's much more self-centered than an internet dominated by lack of identity.

It's perhaps something of an inevitability. You always have the frontier and the cityfolk. The people of the frontier explore, and it's rough, but they have the best time of it they can. Eventually, where riches are struck, the cityfolk move in and carpetbag the place. They ""civilize"" it. What we're seeing now is an attempt by normalfags to ""civilize"" and tame the internet so they can have it. Except they're missing what made the internet so great in the first place. 

It's the equivalent of looking at a house, and saying, ""How new and awesome! I want to buy it and live there! But, I miss the old place. Can we move all the furniture in and redecorate a little?"".

So if you use it, you -do- gain 16.66 potency, which isn't much (especially with PLD weapon damage / str / Oath) but isn't nothing. And while my points below are limiting, they are true a non-trivial amount of the time. i.e. the MT can safely keep Fracture up during phases 1-2 of Twintania, and it's great to use after tank swapping into OT mode if your TP isn't a concern.

The competition for that cross-class slot isn't Stoneskin, it's Protect and Cure. 

Protect can be used to re-buff a resurrected member, provided 1-1A from my other reply aren't issues and there's no chance you will overwrite a Proshell - i.e. either you have no WHM or the member in question is separated from others or there simply isn't relevant magic damage to worry about.

Cure is just-worse than Stoneskin in nearly all use cases, but in certain desperate situations the one less second of cast time or cheaper MP cost can theoretically mean something.

I *am* apprenticed to an attorney who specializes in tax law, and there's nothing shady about the advice given in that document.  It seems to be about eight years old, and laws may have changed since then, but other than that there's no legal issue there.

Here's what you need to understand: tax law is funky.  It has its own highly specific vocabulary, and its rules tend to be just as specific.

Mission Presidents *are not paid* in the eyes of the IRS.  They are reimbursed for volunteer activities for a tax-exempt organization for which they work (more than) full time.  They don't get a salary.  They have to pay off their own credit cards, the mortgage and property taxes on any home they own, etcetera.

The reimbursements do seem generous.  That's not a tax issue.

If you tell the IRS that you get paid, then they'll want to charge you taxes on your salary.  Here's the thing: if a mission president told the IRS that they were paid for their service, they would be *lying.*  It comes back again to that very specific vocabulary.  By the IRS definition, Mission Presidents are not paid, and are not required to report their living expense reimbursements.

If it sounds confusing, that's because it is!  Tax law in the US is a mess.  That's why we have lawyers and accountants who literally do nothing else but help people navigate it without breaking the law or going broke.

I lost every single one of my JW friends. All of them. Which really sucked b/c, yep, I grew up JW. I had to virtually write off all of my childhood friends AND their families (being a JW is living in a small town regardless of where you are) so yeah, it was a lonely time. 

Fast forward nine years later: I have fewer friends than I once did because I'm really choosy and because I value the kind of deep, trusting friendships I felt I had as a JW back when. I'm married with kids and living happily and more spiritual than ever (notice I didn't say ""religious"").

City have made it through the group stages of the Champions league and are battling to retain the premier league title, and they need reinforcements. This is much more important missing some games at the beginning of a season. The CFG ownership made what is overall the best decision and it makes sense. Frank is doing well so simply extend his loan rather then signing another world class midfielder with money that could be used to buy a striker, seeing as we are restricted due to FFP. 
NYCFC fans have the right to be upset seeing as they probably don't support Manchester city anyways but if you think about it, you will probably be dominating MLS in a few seasons and you already have a world class striker. Why support a team over one player anyways? Its the city of New York that NYCFC represents and NYCFC is part of CFG and frankly that partnership is going to benefit in the long run. 
I am also pretty sure that City will send some EDS players as well as another designated player in the mean time so its not like everything is  completely a-wall because frank extended his loan.

I think a lot of this gender stuff is being blown a bit out of proportion. In my opinion authors are artists. I look at books primarily as the author writing something that is enjoyable to them and we're lucky as consumers to be able to buy those stories and read them. 

The choices made by the author were what they felt was best for their story. It's not my job to tell them they did it wrong. I can only say whether I enjoyed the story or not, not that the author was wrong for what they wrote. With fiction at least, and generally always with fantasy the world and characters are not meant to be factual. This means there is little room for the author to be wrong. 

It's like me coming to your job and telling you that you're doing it wrong, but you've been doing the job for 30 years and I've never done it once in my life. 

As consumers though we have the ability to speak with our wallets. If you don't like a story from an author you have every right to not buy more from that author. You can also recommend books that do fit your particular interests. I don't think you have the right to tell an author they're wrong because they wrote something you didn't agree with. Taste, interests and priorities are different for everyone and proclaiming that a book is bad because it doesn't contain ""x"" is just silly. 

Look at Brianna Wu, the game developer who has been harassed by GamerGater's because she's a woman in gaming. She found games weren't catering to her interests so she is creating her own. 

If you find books aren't catering to your interests write your own! If you are finding something is missing from the books you read then you have found a possible niche that you could be highly successful in. Odds are if you're super interested in that type of ""thing"" then there's the possibility others will feel the same way.

With this said, it's fine to feel like women aren't represented properly. But  it's not ""wrong"" to not have female characters in a book. It's simply that an entire category of books could use some love from people who can write about it in an enjoyable way for those of us who want that to read.",Fantasy,t5_2qknd,2.0,

**Edit**

Also note that China really doesn't want Taiwan to be a country, Argentina really doesn't recognize any British rights to the Falklands. 

But the ""story"" going on about Israel is that the Arabs aren't against the existence of Israel, just the occupation and the treatment of the Palestinians.

But they didn't create a ""smaller bordered"" Israel, they removed Israel completely and replaced it with Palestine.

This is proof that the mere existence of Israel is offensive to the Arab world, like Israel keeps claiming and unlike what many ""Israel critics"" would want you to believe. In other words, this insinuates that the problem isn't the occupation but rather the very existence of Israel that drives the conflict.",worldnews,t5_2qh13,7.0,

I mostly support as near perfect equality of opportunity as we can achieve without guaranteeing equality of outcome (though with a solid floor).

There are lots of barriers to exiting poverty, including lack of affordable housing and child care in urban areas, for example, and we should certainly focus on those.

I don't have a solution at hand to income inequality. Piketty proposes a wealth tax, which would have all sorts of unintended consequences, I suspect. Other sorts of tax on the wealthy (e.g. income surtaxes) generate very little revenue and thus are not of that much benefit.

that's a geometry, a specific branch of mathematics.

logic is generally bigger than mathematics, though you can kind of think of mathematics as formalized, symbolic logic if you'd like.

that's engineering.

&gt;  Okay then : We derived mathematics, the first one based on how we thought. You had 1 stone and you added another. You have 2 stones. And this thought developed into what we called mathematics.

sure, at some point we employed certain things as axiomatic because they appeared practical. we probably did this prior to its logical proof in *principia mathematica*. now it's no longer an axiom; it's a theorem. a theorem with a 160-ish page logical proof.

&gt;  Axiom is some statement that is taken for granted without the need of proof. Because the whole field is based upon that statement. Meaning you can't prove axiom. I did not meant 1+1 specifically.

yes, mathematics certain *has* axioms (1+1=2 is not among them). as i pointed out in my initial reply, mathematicians enjoy playing with *different* axioms sometimes, almost recreationally. for instance, i went to a rather fun lecture by john conway once that supposed, axiomatically, a different law of addition.

When I was 17 I left my parents place. We disagreed on a bunch of things and I left. I moved in with my partner and I ended up leaving school. I worked for a few years, then we moved interstate so we could afford to move her little brothers in with us. Their home life was dangerous and they were floundering, so when we took them in it was mainly so they would survive, not so they would thrive. 

We had then for about 5 years, they are back in the other state with their mom. But they are starting to thrive. One is in school again, pursuing the kind of creative stuff he excels at, and the other is calmer, learning to back down and be comfortable with himself, something we never thought would happen. 

Now that all the panic and rage is over I am planning my return to study. I never finished school, so it is a little complex getting into college, but I am doing it. My wife is now getting treatment for her bipolar and is pushing herself hard into that. She is doing really well. 

I am now on the other side of the hard stuff and everything from here will be easier because those other issues are out of the way.

The buildings you're looking at have high rental value, as you pointed out, and cost about as much to own as they do to rent. That's without factoring in principal reduction, tax benefits and (hopefully) appreciation that outstrips inflation. It also doesn't factor in the time value of your down payment. Rather than factor all that yourself, just use this: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html?_r=0

Still the best calculator I've seen. You just need to make sure prices go up, on average, during the time you own it. And they probably will. Inventory in River North remains somewhat depressed, which means prices will continue to rise. I'm thinking 4-5% in 2015. 

Full disclosure, I own a real estate brokerage so *of course* I think it's a good time to buy :-p. But we also do rentals, so I like to think I'm fairly objective.

His attempt at turning Obi-Wan to his side may have been a deception, but it could have been true as well. Perhaps he was simply seeking revenge for the death of his apprentice, Qui-Gon, or for the greater ""death"" of the Order and the Republic itself. 

tl;dr Dooku is a hero on the other side. ",MawInstallation,t5_32f60,5.0,

In 1956 the USS Eaton (DD-510), a Fletcher-Class destroyer, was struck by the USS Wisconsin, Iowa-Class battleship, in dense fog at night. The Wisconsin's bow struck the starboard side of the Eaton just forward of the bridge and just about sliced the ship's bow off. I know it's not the best, but I'll quote Wikipedia here: ""The ship's [Eaton] 1st LT saved the ship by securing bow to stern with anchor chain, and closing WT [watertight] door beside his room.""  
[Here's a photo of the damage to the Eaton](http://imgur.com/jr5ZoZc). Apparently the gash extended 6 feet below the waterline. 
[Here's a photo of the damage to the Wisconsin.](http://i.imgur.com/J0eUz16.jpg) And [here's](http://i.imgur.com/FLcxMtS.jpg) a closer view.
The bow was taken from the unfinished USS Kentucky and put onto the Wisconsin. [Here's a picture of that happening if you're interested.](http://i.imgur.com/CFSFZ4R.jpg) Apparently the operation took 16 days.  
I remember hearing that the Wisconsin is a few feet longer than it was when it was launched because of the bow grafting operation, but I can't find anything to back that up. Still, it's a cool ship and available for tours at Nauticus in Norfolk, VA.",MilitaryPorn,t5_2sq9y,9.0,

Basically a rare commodity is something that can be bought (in limited quantity) in exactly one station per rare commodity (example: Lavian Brandy at Lave Station in Lave). It can be sold at any other station in the galaxy and increases in value the further away from the station you bought it from.

There's a nice overview of 

Your other question:

&gt; is this what people mean by trade routes? They just buy rares and then long haul it to sell them?

It can be, but that's not the only kind of trade route there is. A route for rare trading would typically mean finding multiple stations that sell rares that are relatively close together, loading up with rares from those and then fly ~160ly away to sell it all (if possible to another area of stations that offer rare goods so you can buy new ones and fly back to where you came from).

First imagine what your looking to do. I'd say an MBA is good for changing your career into consulting or banking which will certainly increase your future worth (think 120k-150k salary first year out with high jumps a couple years in) but at the cost of much higher hours. However if you're looking to progress in your current industry, the payoff becomes less clear. However I can say that for larger companies above a certain level almost everyone has an MBA.

I'd say there would be two viable paths I'd consider: 2 year full time MBA and a part time program. If you do a 2 year program make sure you are getting into a top 20 or you will be wasting time and money (you are paying for the network as much as the education and label). A part time program would be less important to look at ranking and perhaps cheaper and could be a good option if you are looking to continue in your current career track.",AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,4.0,

Eyes: Tie between Shiro's Ghost of Colors Past or HW Garden from the November Visage Box! I like Ghost for those single-color wash and go! kind of days and I use Garden as a way to add extra sparkle to pretty much every look.

Lips: I love my lip lustres, but my favorite lip product this year is AFK's Tiny Evil Santa. I like the ease of using it, the lovely brown-tinged red, and the adorably nefarious artwork!

Perfume: Solstice Scents Snowshoe Pass is the closest I've ever come to loving a perfume enough to make it my ""signature scent.""

Lotion: Sixteen 92 Toasted Marshmallow lotion is warm and delicious, and I keep finding my little boy sniffing my hands when I wear it. :P

It's still good if you can say ""well that looks like a pipit, maybe a meadow or tree pipit but I can't remember which is which"". It's still good if you can say ""I know that's a tern not a gull because of the sharply-pointed wings and the slim bill"". IDing the species is great and it's roughly what you're working towards but each rung on the ladder it an achievement in itself.

Also, I recommend using an online birding quiz. I've been using [this one](http://www.birdphotos.com/photos/index.php?q=gallery&amp;g2_itemId=5926&amp;g2_quiz=start0) recently. Check the multiple choice option to start out and do the quiz by country option. It's not the most aesthetically-pleasing layout and if you check 'Allow User Album photos' there may be the very occasional misidentified bird or an image with lots of different species but it should help.

Just doing the quiz for the whole world (don't select a country and leave all the regions checked) might help you learn what features make good field marks and what makes a species fall into a certain group, though you won't have heard of most of the species that come up. What's good is that a lot of the time they have names like ""red-fronted amazon"" and you might notice that all amazons are quite robust and compact-looking greenish parrots, for example, and that the colour of the forehead is a good field mark in amazons.",birding,t5_2qliv,2.0,

Greater acceptance, more working together as a society, etc. Any thoughts that people consider new and morally correct. I'm not arguing against that, I'm just saying people will use it as justification to get angry at people who don't have the same political opinions as them. 

The more I think of this the more I realize I don't really believe in any absolute politics. Everything is situational and at a personal level. I disagree with a vast majority of people, but I'm not certain I'd say I hate them, just I dislike hatred and conflict and feel the only way to move past that is at a personal level. If people can do that, well that's good for them. Change past anywhere at our current level of incredibly basic tribal politics on any significant scale is, well kinda silly and unrealistic. Before I saw fascism as a way to harness this and make everyone relatively happy and alive, but now, ehhh. I'm becoming less of a dreamer and more thinking about moving into the woods with an echo box of like minded people to an extent where conflict would be resolved by agreement to the right of self, but even then I don't feel much morally better. Maybe the only way to be 'right' is to live as a hermit and be free of any poison that comes as a byproduct to human interaction. But that also seems radical and silly. Or maybe no one is right, and anything will work if people get defensive and tribal enough. And I think I just went full circle to why I'm a fascist. ",DebateFascism,t5_2v642,1.0,

I like your phrasing, but it sounds like you are pushing the dialect a little. Your second clip (this desolate world is ruled by dinosaurs) sounded a little forced. Were you channeling Jeremy Clarkson? 

Your third track (about Cousteau) sounded like you were slipping out of character as the narrator in spots. You sounded rushed and in one passage, (""...Others are engineers, marine biologists, archaeologists or navigators"") it sounded like you're saying it with a slight sigh to your voice, which gives the impression of you being very ""matter-of-fact"" with the copy. 

Overall I can see you were going for three different styles of tone, and they came through good. Your range sounds good, though I think clip may be a little too long for a narration VO demo. You might be able to tighten it up a little and give it a sense of urgency. 

Really good job! 

On your commercial demo:
Some good stuff there, but its way too long. As a casting director, I've made my mind up within the first 5 seconds, so you have to really knock me over in a very short amount of time. 

You need to cut down the different spots to basically just one line each. You are trying to show the range to your voice in as short amount of space as possible. 


Overall I'd say this was a very well done demo. Good production (though dont let the music take over the spot) and good variety. I think if you just shortened it and tightened up the speed of everything, it would be a great demo.


Great job!

You are just on the edge of passing so you may want to go back and reevaluate your heat treat process just to be sure if something drifts a bit one way or the other you can maintain conformance.  

I can't speak for every metallurgist out there, but I typically think of hardness as a quick check to verify a material is in a condition that I want.  In your case we want to verify that the material has been heat treated in such a way that it will resist wear.  Other hardness checks will be to verify the heat treat condition to estimate strength of material, or suitability for machining.  I would expect whomever put the limits on the print would have used a coverage factor in their hardness numbers so that being on the bottom or top of the limits would +/- a HRC point or two would still work in the application, but I can't tell you that for sure.

That need to grow is something I feel like gets hamfisted onto people during the show and it's also something that RuPaul and Michelle talk about a lot on What's The Tee. Unfortunately, (and I think Laganja is a clear example of this) as much as Drag Race can be an opportunity to grow, to give enough fame to further a career, dropping that onto someone who isn't ready for it isn't going to turn out well. 

Though Ru and other people involved with the show are clearly interested in increasing the public standing of drag and improving the careers of people who appear on the show, in the end the show is about offering reality TV show drama. 

I do think though, that the show has reached a level of following (and with the potential expansion to the UK) that some of that could be dispensed with. It certainly seems to me that the highlights of the show have been the caring ones (e.g. Raven and Jujubee breaking down during All Stars) and that the lows have been when the endless dramatic bullshit carries on (like the Heathers, followed by that fake-ass apology from Raja during the season finale).

I am glad that Laganja has been getting her life together. I still have hopes for Beyond Belief becoming a show, and I would much rather see a healthy, sane Laganja, than the unbearable one we got on Drag Race.",rupaulsdragrace,t5_2t3or,5.0,

The Mech Tournament
---
Cyberpunk world where PCs are a team of mech pilots in what is basically a mix of Phantom Crash/Steel Lancer Arena International and Zoids New Century. Mech battles are tuned to use nonlethal ordinance and viewed as a sport, players compete their way through tourney. 

The game has a vast underground gambling circuit, which has led to the formation of what is basically mafia families who various competitors work with to purchase better rides or to sabotage rivals. More successful ones can get sponsorship from more ""legit"" companies, advertising toothpaste, shoes, etc.

Idea would be to have a ""pre-match"" time where you'd be preparing and living in the cyberpunk world, and a ""match"" period as a big robot loaded with weapons.

Village Quest 2100
---
The idea is that PCs are jointly in charge of a village as chiefs or whatever. Each of them has a small contingent of followers who will follow them for whatever reason: say, like 50-100 guys. See if they try to expand the village, war with each other, try to move the whole village somewhere else, whatever. 

As far as setting goes...I've bounced back and forth between so many different things. Goblin Tribes, Fantasy Humans, Post Apocalypse Survivors, Native Americans...I've never come up with something I actually liked enough to settle on. 

Resident Evil 4: The Campening
---
I kinda always wondered what would happen if I took RE4 and turned it into a tabletop with little to no adjustments. how fast would it take for the PCs to screw up everything, even if they knew from meta-knowledge basically what the story was?

In mechs that give individual bonuses (Loyalty Points, C-Bills, etc), your performance in that mech will be counted only during that mech's phase. 

If your mech with bonuses puts a big goose egg on the scoreboard in the first phase, expect it to have the same result as if you just ran out of bounds at the start of dropping it solo.

One thing I'm trying to experiment with that I haven't done yet, is seeing how assists carry over. 

Let's say you scramble your first wave light mech over the walls and plink all 12 enemy mechs for at least a damage each and die.
Your second wave is your mech with bonuses to CBills. That mech finds a cozy corner and sits AFK for the entire match as your team battles it out. 

Assuming your team kills at least the first wave of mechs, you'll end with 0 damage on your ""bonus"" mech, but 12 assists. Will those assists count for the first mech that died, or will those assists count for your one with bonuses - as it was the one that was alive for when the enemy mechs went down?

I'm sorry for the inconvenience but these things weren't exactly designed for midair exits. Hopefully whatever broke the plane killed the engines.

 The hard lane, aka offlane, is used mostly for heroes that require fast levels and have an important ultimate ability that they want to get. In competitive and high level games you will most likely be solo in the hard lane so you can get the most exp. This means that your 2 supports and carry will be on the other side lane. Likewise, you will be facing the enemy's 2 supports and carry so it will be somewhat hard to get farm and come close to lane if the supports are doing their job. 

At lower level games, there will be a support in each lane instead of putting them both in one lane (known as a dual lanes). You'll be able to get to the creeps easier but you're splitting the exp with the other support.",learndota2,t5_2tta4,1.0,

3. Celebrar las primeras elecciones de la historia (al menos en los últimos 6000 años) en democracia.

Woke up from surgery didn't know where I was, had a friend drive me home and had the splints in for a week. Getting them out hurt and they pulled huge goops of blood and what not. Second one not as great except for the cartilage from my ear the had to graft for my nose. That hurt extremely bad. Woke up felt great tried to fight the nurse since I hate the state he's from. Then apologized when the drugs wore off. Didn't have splints or anything but got sick that night from the anesthesia. About a week and a half after surgery my nose started bleeding really bad. Like a waterfall for about 30-45 minutes at a time. After a night of that I went to the er and they didn't believe me and put some gel up my nose. About 5 days later I was laying down about to go to sleep and I feel and taste blood running down the back of my throat. I run to the bathroom and blood is pouring out my nose for about 90 minutes. I tell my wife to get my clothes and a bucket because I need to go to the er. I get to the er and they put one iv in each arm and keep putting some liquid up my nose. Next thing I know a doctor comes in with three nurses to put sponges up my nose. They wouldn't let me lean forward because I could pass out from blood loss but every time I lean forward I choke on my blood and can't breath. I keep trying to lean forward but the nurses held me down and I was coughing up blood. I passed out from pain/blood loss/not breathing and when I woke up I was covered in blood in pain about to throw up. A surgeon had to come in and cauterize my nose since there was a small hole in an artery in my nose. About 2 weeks later I smell something very bad. Like rotting flesh/raw sewage and even my friends and wife can smell it. I thought there was an infection so I called my doctor to ask and she was going on vacation so she couldn't see me but referred me to another one. He called three days later on a thursday and told me it might be a booger or an infection but couldn't see me until the next week. The next day I had this terrible taste in my mouth and felt like I had a booger in my nose. the whole day I was blowing my nose and finally something came out. The biggest booger I've ever seen. About 1.5 inches in diameter. That repeated itself every two weeks for about 3 months. Both surgeries failed",WTF,t5_2qh61,168.0,

They're not, though.  They're like 1%.  Populations in WoW aren't natural.  People go where the action is.  And people that can afford server transfers are also people that can afford to buy gold, so that's where the gold sellers go.

There are a lot of other factors.  I make more in a day on my high pop server than I do in two months on my low pop server.  The buyers just aren't there.

A) This team had arguably one of the worst offensive lines (at least on the interior) in the league and that hampered everything Marrone might've wanted to do from running the ball (single highest yardage in a game by a Bills RB this season - Fred Jackson with 71) to calling screens (lots of Bills fans screamed for them until they saw why Marrone didn't call them a lot - the guards couldn't get outside to block

B) He had the worst quarterbacking in the league (ok, maybe bottom-5 depending on how you want to quantify it). How would we, as Bills fans, know our QBs weren't hitting open WRs deep all the time *if they weren't open to begin with?*

C) Despite that, he ended up with a winning record and went 2-1 against 3 of the top teams in the league in the last 4 weeks of the season. Yes, he lost the Oakland game. But I don't necessarily blame him for that since there was no execution 

D) Most Bills fans hated his tendency to be conservative; i.e. not throwing it enough deep (just to ""see what happens"") or not going for it enough or at the right times on 4th down, even though it's pretty clear they couldn't run the ball up the middle at all and couldn't throw it accurately and the defense was winning games, not the offense, so why not gamble on them).

All that said, I'm not heartbroken by this. Anyone but Rex Ryan will do fine. 

**tl;dr** he had lots of issues, some overblown, some not, that I disagree with, but in the end nobody is heartbroken (though some people do seem upset he'd choose long-term job security with a new team as opposed to gambling that new ownership would give him an extension after this year)",nfl,t5_2qmg3,8.0,

You had to write all your own units, etc. I remember the first time I tried to switch to systemd and after that whole ordeal my system wouldn't shutdown correctly... it was in the background for archlinux for a while.

What happened was two-fold:

1. rc.conf was showing cracks. It used to configure everything but slowly things started leaving it. Stuff like `/etc/modprobe.d` or `/etc/module-load.d` landed which provided a better interface than the rc.conf file. Networking started getting too complicated to stick entirely in rc.conf so netcfg was made. But netcfg then ment code duplication with rc.conf. Backgrounding processes in rc.conf was a hack at best, etc, etc.

2. The developers, one by one, started going out of their way to use systemd over initscripts. The systemd switchover came when they realized they had no one testing the initscripts anymore. And no-one competent steped up.

Archlinux, for better or worse, revolves around the whims of the dev team. It is their baby and they make it suit themselves. With the mindshare shifted to systemd, it only made sense to transistion to it for ease of maintinance.",linux,t5_2qh1a,15.0,

Getting crit in the first few levels is a really silly ideology. You're trading off huge early game damage for the possibility of a crit. 

I usually rush phase and drum, and then go from there. Early game, stats are fucking critical to Jugg. His agi buff helped, but he still has a tiny HP and Mana pool. Investing into stats with both items and build will help you SO much. 

After drums, you have the option of going straight into Aghs, or heading for Maelstrom OR Bfury to accelerate farm. You skip Aghs if you're up against hard omnislash counters like Dazzle, Omniknight, Shadow Demon, Oracle etc. etc. 

Also skip Aghs if you feel like you are not ahead enough to succesfully complete the Aghs quickly. If you're a little behind in farming, Mael is a great way to catch up.

A 600cc bike will be more dependent on corner speed than a 1000cc bike will, but if you run a stock 1000 vs. a 1000 with a lot of motor work, the stock bike will make time up on the worked over bike through corner speed. That same concept applies to cars as well.

The biggest difference I notice between cars and bikes on track is that the lines are slightly different because of the lack of width of a bike. My turn-in points are significantly earlier on a bike than on a car and my exit points are roughly the same.

Regarding weight transfer - it's a tool to help you corner more efficiently on both a car and a bike. The suspension setup on a particular vehicle plays a big role on how important weight transfer is. With soft suspension you notice weight transfer a lot more and you can use it to load the tires more to get a bigger contact patch.

Also, the transmission is for going fast, the brakes are for slowing down. Don't rely on downshifting to scrub speed.

I think it's very unlikely that this was an intentional act of foreshadowing by the writers.

The Klingon invasion of Cardassia depicted in 'The Way of the Warrior' at the start of Season 4 was a pretext for bringing Worf onto Deep Space Nine and Michael Dorn into the show as a regular cast member. 

DS9 producers have stated that the conflict with the Klingons in Season 4 was an unplanned detour in the series. They'd dropped hints of the Dominion in Season 2. They'd introduced us to the Dominion in Season 3, and started setting up a conflict between the Dominion and the Federation. Season 4 was supposed to be when things heated up between the Dominion and the Federation.

However, instead, a decision had been made in the hiatus between Seasons 3 and 4 to bring Michael Dorn into the series to try and improve ratings. Therefore, they came up with the conflict between the Klingons and the Federation to justify having Worf on Deep Space Nine. This delayed the Dominion War by a year.

Given that the decision to bring Michael Dorn into the cast of DS9 and manufacture the Klingon-Federation conflict was made only during the hiatus between Seasons 3 and 4, it's *extremely* unlikely that the writers knew about this a year earlier.

Remember that DS9 was one of the pioneers of serialised long-form television - and it didn't fully commit to this concept until later in the series. Unlike its contemporary 'Babylon 5', there was no five-year plan for DS9. For the first couple of years, it was a very episodic show. They were making things up as they went along. Rather than foreshadowing later events in earlier episodes, what they generally did was use earlier episodes as inspiration for later events. A really good example of this was Odo's killing another Changeling in the final episode of Season 3. This was inspired by a line in an earlier episode, where the female Changeling had told Odo that ""No Changeling has ever harmed another."" - said in the first episode of that season. The writers have said that the inspiration for Odo killing the other Changeling was that earlier line. They basically wrote an episode based on that line. However, this was calling back, rather than foreshadowing - and the DS9 writers did a lot of this. In retrospect, we assume it's foreshadowing because we've seen so many serialised shows that came after DS9 do this. However, DS9, as a pioneer of this form of television, didn't quite know what it was doing and was breaking fresh ground. What we think was foreshadowing was usually the writers calling back to an earlier episode after the fact, rather than planning a future episode in advance.

Not Christian so I cant say their reasons but probably its the in your face gay shit that pisses many off. Me I think the gov should be out of marriage all together. But at the same time I wouldn't want my kids with my downtown for a gay pride rally.

&gt;Why do conservatives lambast so-called Black-culture?

Have you seen what constitutes ""black culture""?

&gt;It's because of their belief in hierarchy and societal order (with them at the top).

Its more like as a white male, I don't want to pay for you, I don't want to hear how I oppressed you (I haven't), I'm sick of hearing about some supposed privilege (I grew up poor as shit), etc. I want to be left the fuck alone.

It doesn't have tweezers, but is has everything else that you want. The size it perfect for in the pocket. There are some other tools that have tweezers, but it looks to me like they have less useful screwdrivers on them. The Skeletool has different bits that you can take out/replace, and you can get a kit with a bunch more bits that work with it.

EDIT: There are a couple different versions of the Skeletool. The regular version is fine, but the CX version has a 154CM blade, which many will tell you is a very good blade steel. I think many feel it's superior to the AUS8 used by your 5.11 Scout. The regular version uses 440HC, which is still respectable.

Unfortunately 20 is a *bit* too young for me, otherwise I'd take you up on your generous offer. :)

So, I didn't go to school, and it hasn't been a hindrance for me. I figured with the 50k I'd spend on school, not counting the insane amounts of interest, I could get a head start on my investment portfolio. Fortunately for me I was right. 

It also helps to be able to write and speak legibly: I'm a true believer that the gift of gab is worth its weight in gold. If you can speak to people in a manner they enjoy, the world opens up, regardless of the letters behind your name. 

That being said, I'm not *against* school, and especially if you live in a country that pays for it, by all means, continue your education. And you're right, a business degree seems like a good choice. Truth be told I was never much good at school (it's hard for me to sit still and concentrate), so it was an easy choice for me to put my money elsewhere. 

YOU ABSOLUTELY DON'T HAVE TO END UP IN A BORING OFFICE JOB! There are plenty of people who enjoy the solace and anonymity provided by an office job - leave those jobs to the people who love them. Because if you don't, and if you would be miserable in such, then for fucks sake, don't do that to yourself. Even if you have a tough time finding a job - and believe me, I've been there - find something else with which to make money while you search. There are an infinite amount of ways to make cash, and the more you cultivate those, the better you get/the more money you make. For instance, I have flipped furniture, painted, sold things on ebay/craigslist, guest bartended ... really, there are so many things you can do to make money. The notion of ""The American way is to get a job in your twenties and work the same job until you're 65 and get your pension and live in your little house with your little wife until you die"" are over, man. We live in a society that now embraces creativity (which they should, as all invention comes from creative thought), and there's so much out there that's just ripe for the taking. Yes, you have to work hard. Yes, you have to sacrifice. And for fuck's sake, be on time to things - tardiness is a sure way to get the boot.

Sometimes people just can't get along as a couple and being supportive and amicable co-parents is the best thing they can do for their baby. As long as you intend to support and be there for your child, you are doing the right thing. People aren't tied to others forever and the notion of staying together for the kids just doesn't work. Kids don't have the scope to imagine external factors and when mommy and daddy are spending the day unhappy and yelling at each other, they often think that this is their fault. 

Try talking to her, pregnancy hormones can really influence things but that's not really an excuse to treat a person like crap. Eventually, if you give up everything in life you're going to become resentful. You can hang out with your friends without being considered childish. 

Just tell her how you feel when she treats you a certain way. Try to be open and communicate with each other. Relationships are team work, and so is parenting. ",relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,1.0,

The fact that OP is repeating the DHS/SPLC witch hunt propaganda about ""sovereign citizens"" is one red flag, aside from the obvious one of advocating violent action in context with current events. Reminds me of how [this guy](http://www.democracynow.org/2014/2/25/exclusive_inside_the_army_spy_ring) actually thought anti-war protesters were actually Jihadist sympathizers and would go for that. Maybe agents that are able to really do their homework on what their targets think, build rapport, and really talk the talk aren't plentiful.

That said, TPTB already have other ways to arbitrarily hang you, threaten you, or otherwise ruin your life if they want to, other than getting you to say something incriminating. As the U.S. declines, this sort of discussion will be more common. There are certain things we're afraid to discuss philosophically and even use intellectually dishonest pacifist rhetoric, e.g. telling statists that ""the state is based on violence"", which is true, but dishonest to omit that the enforcement of our ideals would not ultimately be the same in that regard. 

I'd think it's obvious that private property and individual rights require violence and coercion to maintain against people that don't give a shit. I'm afraid that being unable to discuss how force is applied, especially during early implementation in a volatile social environment, warps our actual philosophy. I really hope that everyone here understands the distinction between defense and aggression, and has given some thought to the moral status of organized aggressors who self-identify as members of a group that is aggressive by definition, beyond the thought-terminating cliche of dismissing any common categorization of multiple individuals as ""collectivism"".",Anarcho_Capitalism,t5_2qorf,1.0,

If you look at my linked post, then you will see that I'm not arguing for Bitcoin or one of its clones.  Bitcoin pays it's miners too much.  ASIC miners are bound to become really cheap 'smart heaters'.  It's absurd to spend so much to heat an empty warehouse.  Pay for mining at a loss instead, small miners will use mining to subsidize heating costs, and large scale mining will evaporate.  ASICs are the future of decentralized  network computing.

I'm not talking about protocol changes.  It's unrealistic to base a currency on a fixed monetary policy.

""Run for your life! It's the end of the world!"" The ground shook violently as smoke billowed and rolled from the hill. I backed away, then turned and ran to my vehicle, glancing behind me every few seconds. I hopped into my DeLorean and sped off, trying to dodge plummeting fireballs as I fiddled with the settings on my dashboard. August 8, 2015. That would do.

I slammed my foot on the gas pedal. 75. I swerved just in time to avoid a flaming chunk of rock. 82. I glanced sheepishly into my rear view mirror. An expanding hemisphere of pyroclastic smoke was rapidly approaching. 87. Any time now. 88. My car suddenly disappeared in a bright flash, leaving behind a trail of fire, which was soon enveloped by suffocating blackness.

It's true, screens and a time-tested way of dealing with an aggressive pass rush. A well set up screen to a running back is a thing of beauty. A freakin' quick-out screen to a wide receiver in the flat that has been run ad nauseum to little effect all season, is not. It's a cause for groaning.

But those plays aside, Bevell is an offensive coordinator in the NFL. We play the Rams, Cardinals and 49ers twice a year, every year. Even if he suffers from some sort of short term memory loss, he has access to mountains of game film. And the Rams, and Cardinals pass rush has not changed.

So why would anyone, given our offensive line, try drop-backs against them? Why would someone have to be told by the head coach to ditch the drop-backs, and enable Russell to get rid of the ball quicker?

Speaking strictly for myself, Bevell's apparent refusal to help out his young quarterback against the pass rush is something I've complained about repeatedly. It's always ""adjustments"", and usually, not until the second half. How about getting ahead of the game a little bit?

Instead of ""drop back, almost get our quarterback killed"" then adjusting, how about assume the Rams are the same team they've been the last 4 or 5 times we've played them? If their rush gets less aggressive, THEN do a drop-back.",Seahawks,t5_2ryle,8.0,

The Wild Hunt is able to send ghosts to the Witcher world (seemingly whenever they want) and enter the world physically (seemingly only in certain areas like the North and only during certain times); they also are able to travel to some other parallel worlds, however they are limited in their destinations until they regain their ability again.

All this is however very unclear. There are mentions of a certain Spire of time where the Hunt will finally catch Ciri (I read the books in Russian so the translation is not the most accurate one; from what I remember the King of the Wild Hunt said something like 'during your travels you will stumble upon the Spire sooner or later; and this is when we will catch you'), however I can't explain what this spire is. It is not fully explained why the Hunt sends ghosts instead of coming in person, it is hinted that it costs a lot of effort and is not time-efficient to enter the world in person. As to the reason *why* the Hunt visits other worlds - they kidnap humans and force them into slavery (Ciri meets humans in the Wild Hunt homeworld and everybody mentions people disappearing when the Wild Hunt visits an area). It also seems that certain elven magicians (Aen Saevherne) are able to travel through space; during his travels to find Ciri Geralt meets an Aen Saevherne named Avallac'h who tells Geralt of Ciri and her destiny; Ciri later meets him in the Aen Elle world (he is the first one to greet her; he is the magician who set up the whole project on regaining control over the space travel and he was destined to become Lara Dorren's husband, but she fell in love with a human).

Basically, the whole idea by elven magicians was: we genetically breed several generations of Aen Saevherne until we get a perfect child that will have the control over space travel. This child should have been the child of Avallac'h and Lara Dorren, it seems; but Lara Dorren had other plans. Several generations later Ciri, being her heir, steps in to fulfill this role, or so the Aen Elle wish. Ciri also doesn't want any part of this.

There's a short term relationship between unemployment and inflation. This is known as the Phillips Curve. Lower inflation usually correlates with higher unemployment and vice versa. In the long run there isn't much evidence of this, but deflation is an indicator of a wide range of other economic problems. It can be an indicator of a possible recession. Hence why some countries in Europe are currently experiencing deflation. 

Of course, too much inflation is also a bad thing, and it can lead to something called stagflation, in which unemployment remains high while growth slows. Basically meaning the economy is somewhat fucked. You don't wanna be there. It's possible that Russia is or will be experiencing stagflation soon. Stagnation was rampant in the 1970s, and it arguably ruined and ended the dominance of Keynesian left-wing economic policy in much of the West.

I can tell you haven't met many scientists.

&gt;Do the math of general relativity and you will come out with the exact same result Einstein did. There is no fucking questioning it. You are not arbitrarily going to get a different result every time you do the math.

""Listen and Believe' is a really bad policy when it comes to anything.  You can accept a fact as true while still understanding it could be proven wrong later.  Our understanding of modern physics relies on things like the speed of light being a limit for acceleration, but at the same time we understand how little we know about the universe.  

&gt;This is why unless you understand it, avoid talking about it. Cause ""questioning assumptions, therefore FTL travel may be possible"" is about as retarded as you can sound.

NASA has done work on a warp drive, including an idea called an [Alcubierre Drive.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive)  Obviously, all this work is purely speculative, the Alcubierre drive requires a yet undiscovered exotic material that may or may not exist, **but they are still doing it**.

Yes, it is. In that time, you could just bring things back on track.

&gt; You just talking over someone you feel isn't saying anything important is plain passive aggressive.

There's that word again, ""feel."" That someone might not be saying the most important thing isn't a feeling, it's an assertion. Try ""think"" next time.

Further, I rarely if ever think anyone ""isn't saying anything important."" I'm not a black and white thinker, and I work with competent people. At times, what one person has to say is more important than what another person is saying, probably because the point has already been made and the person is continuing unnecessarily. 

&gt;plain passive aggressive.

It would be, if I thought about my peers that way, but I don't. I think you need to learn to respect others. It would make it much easier for you to assume they respect you by default when you're working with them, and not take inconsequential interactions personally.

Somehow these RMT guys are simultaneously super geniuses who can keep the exploit secret and idiots who don't start selling until the price has fallen out.

The latest piece of conflicting information is a doozie. As I'm reading the article by David Lohr I'm thinking *this is great,up to date and he even interviewed a State Trooper that investigated the accident.* 

Then as I'm about half way through the article this catches my eye:

&gt;Hager had been visiting his girlfriend in Fairfax County, Virginia, and had left her home at about 7:45 a.m. on the day of the crash. Later that day, Hager stopped at his father's home in Gloucester County. His father wasn't there at the time, but Hager did call him at about 12 p.m.

7:45 am??? 12:00 pm???? I thought this accident happened at 1:30 am!!!!! All the information I saw prior to this article says 1:30 AM!!! Go back to the beginning of the article and read this:

&gt;That's what police found at the crash scene on the afternoon of Monday, June 26, 1995, 

AFTERNOON????? What???? Wait a minute!!! 


Did you hear that???? That was the sound of my head exploding!

I think this one can be solved if everyone that is attempting to solve it is working with the same valid facts.    

I just joined WebSluths in hope of finding some accurate information on this case. I'll post back here when I know I am basing my theories on known facts.

I'd imagine some of the blame for his percentage allowed has to go on team defense and guards allowing too much penetration. Stretch bigs also aren't really known for their defense to begin with.

On offense, he's had a down season shooting from 3 at 34%, but last 4 years he's been consistently 38-41% from 3 at 5-7 attempts a game. He's also not even 30 yet, not sure why you're saying he's just getting by on his reputation. Montiejunas is a nice player, but he's not nearly the stretch big threat Anderson is. Montiejunas is 29% from 3 with 1.6 attempts a game... and that's actually his best so far out of the 3 years he's had.

You also have to look at their impact on offense as a whole rather than their individual numbers. Stretch bigs open up the driving lanes and open up the paint for low post players like... Dwight (Lewis in Orlando). It's also been a noticeable part of offense for the Spurs (Matt Bonner) and Suns (formerly Channing Frye) in the past.

It's a difficult enough experience already, and it's doubly vulnerable when you suspect that a friend has betrayed you.  The comments I'm leaving are not meant to criticize, just to hopefully arm you with some new ideas to deal with this situation and future ones.

You're clearly worried about the possibility that all he wanted was sex, but reading through your post, I don't actually see anything about emotion.  You say you became ""sexually involved"" but don't say anything about love.  You say he was ""keen on seeing me again"" but don't say whether he was in love or just horny.  Emotion is clearly very important to you, so why don't you say anything about it?

I think the reason you don't say anything explicitly about emotion is that to you, the simple facts of having sex, seeing or not seeing each other, and texting more or less often imply everything we would want to know about what was happening emotionally.  And that just isn't the case.  The connection between sex and emotion is very complicated and flexible; it varies from person to person and from situation to situation.   The only reason we can read between the lines and guess what your expectations were is that this is a common story for inexperienced people.

I'm not even sure whether I should feel angry at him.  If he feigned emotions that he didn't feel in order to have sex with you, then that's bad and you have every right to be angry.  He failed you as a friend.  But... you don't say that.  There's so much you don't say.  If you assume those things don't need to be said, then maybe the misunderstanding between you and him came about because of your unspoken expectations and not because of anything he did to mislead you.  Maybe he was completely blindsided by your post-coital expectations and is scared to see you now because he knows you're angry.  Who knows.  I think you should call him up and have a conversation with him where you talk explicitly about the emotional aspects of what happened.

The outcome might not be what you hope for, but I think it'll be a huge relief for both of you if you can articulate what you felt, what you expected, what you thought he felt, what you thought would happen after sex, and how you feel now.  It won't be a conversation that gets you what you want — you should accept the past as past — but it will clear the air, and maybe you will be able to gauge from his response whether he intentionally disregarded your feelings and whether you want to continue being his friend.

Because of this arcane is on top because it does the most DPs in situations where there is little movement.  Bit if you have a fight with lots of movement you lose a lot of dps as arcane which is why people really on use it on those types of fights such as butcher.  Fire is the worst spec ATM even accounting for BR gear albeit sans tier sets and while I agree with what you said fire still wasn't top during soo because you can do all the DMG you want standing still but there are very few fights like that.

EVO's main events are Street Fighter, Marvel, and King of Fighters.  But the biggest Street Fighter tournament is now Capcom Cup, Marvel is declining is doomed to die, and KOF doesn't have much of a presence in the states.  Anime games are bigger at NEC, Tekken gets low turnouts at EVO for some reason, and the other 3D games are on life support even in comparison to Tekken.  Killer Instinct I'll admit I know little about, but they're hard to access since they're XB1 exclusive.

It's pretty much just Street Fighter that has a healthy scene, and they stand to grow even more with the Capcom sponsored tournaments and the release of SF5.

If it's cheaper to rent, then it's cheaper to rent, and you should do that as long as possible -- it may even give you time for the market to correct and for buying to be cheaper again (the normal case, the past few years of the bubble notwithstanding) -- it's not going to be more ideal to move that purchase up sooner. 

Of course, the other thing is that the market does change and correct over time. Renting being cheaper than owning is weird, historically, and will likely not last (though that doesn't mean a crash next month -- these things take years and years to work out). 

And buying *sounds* better, ""not paying rent"" just kind of rolls off the tongue. It's a cognitive trap that's easy to fall into.

As far as canon goes, Hyrule Historia isn't exactly the only canon, as official game guides and the information derived from the games themselves would obviously be canon, it's just not all canonically comprehensively in one place (other than HH, while touching on many topics, is lacking in full detail on many subjects) - which is where the Wikis come in. 

Anyway, another big difference between the two is intent. Dark Link usually shows up as a trial for Link - basically he must defeat himself. The method behind it's creation varies, though. Shadow Link and his multiple copies, however, show more will and is a constant, recurring foil to the 4 Links throughout their journey, not mimicking the Links, but causing chaos.

Obviously, I get a good chunk of each working on bounties every day, but on the ""down time"" when I am just playing the game and not working toward a bounty or daily or anything, which is a better rep to farm?

Well, both, unless you want to join a faction (New Monarchy obviously being the best choice, but there are those *other* groups, too).  If you're going to just pick one, I would recommend Vanguard, simply because you can obtain marks at a MUCH quicker rate.  

The reason I recommend both is because it lets you level up much faster (i.e., you can buy gear using both marks), and it gives you access to a wider variety of gear choices.  If you go the faction route, find the faction with gear that caters to your playstyle.

&gt; Second Question: Should I be doing a faction rep instead? I read an old guide when I first hit 20 that said as a Titan I should be getting the dead orbit faction rep first, so I was about 80% to ranking up in there when I saw on this subreddit that I should NOT be doing factions first. What is the most beneficial?

I don't know any reason to wait - if you want Dead Orbit gear, level up Dead Orbit.  If you DO go that route, you should at least be equipping DO items when playing Crucible.

&gt; Third Question: I have a few legendary guns (A rocket launcher, the zombie apocalypse machine gun, and the gun that was rewarded from doing the Dark Below quests) but I don't know of a good way to farm the materials to level them up. Is there an easier way than just patrolling the planets arbitrarily to get the mats?

You get a few materials for doing the Patrol Bounties.  You also get some from Daily missions, if I recall correctly.  Lastly, you can buy materials from either Quartermaster, at a rate of 20 mats for 10 marks.

&gt; Fourth Question: If I want to find people to party with, where can I go? There doesn't seem to be any resource in-game, and I really don't think I can solo the vault of glass or a nightfall strike (once I get to that level).

You can randomly solicit people in the tower.  /r/fireteams is a great tool.  There's also destinylfg.net.  Lastly, you can join a clan...add several of the members to your friends list, and you can join in when you see them doing it.  (PS: Soloing the nightfall is tough, but possible with the right gear...you can't solo the Vault).

""*Performative Nick Young fandom*

As far as NBA players go, Nick Young is alright. On most teams, he would get 10 minutes per game; on the Lakers, he should probably be a starter. He takes a lot of shots, scores some points, plays bad defense, and doesn't do much of anything else at all. He's average on a good day, passably bad on all others.

And yet, basketbloggers won't shut the fuck up about 'Swaggy P' (an idiotic nickname that Young gave himself). These basketbloggers, ready as ever to feign enthusiasm for some middling player as a way to show themselves to be basketball connoisseurs of true discernment, have embraced Young like he's the second coming of Christ himself. They freak out over GIFs of him doing something slightly out of the ordinary, latch onto his every postgame word, and are waaaaaay too invested in his relationship with Iggy Azalea.

Left alone, Nick Young is only a smoldering ember of ridiculousness. But basketbloggers provide the oxygen to turn him into a firestorm of annoyance, where his off-the-court antics draw most of the attention, and the only time his play is mentioned is to collectively freak out when he attempts some off-balance 29-foot turnaround three with 22 seconds left on the shot clock. In 2015, I hope we pay as much attention to him as we do to Gary Neal. — Kevin Draper""

So, through trial and error I learned:

* Make sure your bottom coat is as dry as possible! You want to be able to smooth out any bubbles without having to worry about messing up your mani.   
* Make sure your tape is as unsticky as possible. It should be more like applying a window decal. I find shitty dollar store off-off brand tape is awesome for this. You can also apply the tape to your palm to pick up some oil and dirt and stuff to cut the stickiness. Don't worry! I won't transfer to your nails. 
* Try to keep your strokes going away from the edges of your tape. When you brush up against the tape, you could be squishing polish through any bubbles you might have missed. If you have a lot of lines, you can go parallel to them and it'll help.
* Plan your lines so you don't need too many coats to get it opaque. The polish that needs the most coats to be opaque should be your bottom coat whenever possible.
* Along with the tip above, don't let the polish dry for too long before taking the tape off. The drying polish will soften the polish beneath it and you might mess up your design. You should be taking the tape off once the polish is just getting sticky, but is still slightly liquid. It'll keep your it's shape and give you super clean lines. Too dry and you might get chipping. It depends on the formula though, so definitely experiment. 

These worked for me and the polishes I have. Different techniques work for different people. I have pretty low patience for day long manicures too and I usually slap on a coat of quick dry top coat as soon as I take my tape off and call it a day.

The matches are fairly short (10 min) and packed with action: except for the first turn you will keep fighting until the end. Because the arena is so small there almost isn't any time lost moving your champions in position.",AndroidGaming,t5_2s2ul,2.0,

I asked the realtor specifically how much each unit was renting for and she only knew what 2 of the 3 units were renting for.  She said that the home owner wants out bad, and basically said the owner doesn't have the ability to ask the current tenants for more rent (because she doesn't have the backbone) and as a result the 2 units that are currently rented are probably about 20% below what other similar units are renting for (This is from my research, not from the realtor).  She also said that the home owner probably doesn't have a good record of all the documents I was asking for...I asked for rent roll, expenses, etc.  The home is actually in a pretty nice neighborhood.  We drove the street and looked at other houses, there are some nice amenities close by.  

Also...the realtor said that the 3rd unit, the one that she didn't know how much the home owner was charging for, is currently occupied by a family member.  I really hope she's not going to come back and say the family member is living there for free...or that the family member is living there without a lease.

I was around 20 when I first started channeling. But I've been having experiences my whole life. It was only around 20 that I found out exactly what was going on, and really became able to control what was happening to me. 

I found out through blind ghost box sessions. I would put on headphones so that I couldn't hear any of my friend's questions, and I would just say what I heard through it. That got us some pretty good results, and eventually they started talking about what I was and what I could do. From there, I just started having things come through me. It was a sort of this-is-the-right-time sort of thing. 

My main sources are things that you could call guardians. They go by a couple different names, but that one's pretty explanatory on what they are. 

As far as what I've heard about 2015 through different sessions, they seem to think there's going to be a fair bit of turmoil. They've been on this since 2014, though, and they seem to think that each year is bringing more things lining up to create an eventual breaking point. 

They don't think that breaking point is an apocalypse or something like that. From what I gathered, though, we're leading up to something 'world-changing'. From context clues, they seem to be referring to something along the lines of either another world war, or perhaps a world-wide rebellion/revolution that changes the way things are done?

Combine that with limiting the amount of time for someone's turn to a minute and you'll have a pretty fast combat. Also if the players are trustworthy (I have a guy who would've fudged his rolls if I had done this, but I'd have let others do it) they can even roll for attack and damage before their turn.

Of course, there's the coldly pragmatic 'it will happen, don't question it, just protect yourself' with which we can all agree.

Hours, even years, of earnest work can be destroyed in the aftermath of heists like this.  These hackers are not robots, they're humans, so why do they do it?  You may call it inevitably ugly human nature, but I was brought up not to do this kind of thing. Presumably you were too... so what is it?  Economic need? Notoriety? Ignorant curiosity?  It's great that we share these precautions and adopt a protective mindset, but honestly I think as a community we could be less blithe about our acceptance of hacking risk.

If you play more PvE, like strikes, raids and story missions. Level up vanguard. If you play mostly PVP/crucible level up faction rank. Factions only take crucible marks as currency, so leveling them up while getting vanguard marks is a waste of time. I put on faction gear only for crucible.

&gt;Second Question: Should I be doing a faction rep instead?

I would recommend only working on vanguard rank til it's level 3 unless you play mostly crucible.

&gt;Third Question: Is there an easier way than just patrolling the planets arbitrarily to get the mats?

You can buy 20 materials for 10 marks from vanguard and crucible quartermaster. You may have to be a certain rank to do so.

&gt;Fourth Question: If I want to find people to party with, where can I go? 

I prefer /r/fireteams but destinylfg.net is popular too. These are the best options.

Really? I always thought that hers was one of the better 3 routes. I thought Asuho's and Aoi's were bland. 

&gt;Two things screw her route though. The H scenes, more so than the other routes, just felt like pandering.

The biggest problem with them was that Chinami felt like she had the brain of a 10 year old, and you can imagine how awkward having sex with an idiot would look. 

&gt;Really, the only downside of their routes was ~~no threesome~~ needing to suspend one's disbelief a bit, but the VN did a good job of explaining everything that needed to be explained, and at the end of the day, that's really all I ask.

To me, the biggest downside of their routes had to do with the way they're set up. [spoiler] (/s ""Komomo's route starts off making you think it's going to be about her, but then we figure out it was Kosame all along, so her own route was more about Kosame than her. Kosame's route was ok, except that you essentially knew most everything going into her route which ruined a lot of chances for nice buildup and suspense that her route could've had. Also the fandisc has a threesome with both of them, so rejoice"")

There's no possible way they could be ""polar opposites"" considering fascist economics were derived from syndicalism and socialism, although I will say they may have certain traits than can be seen as opposite of each other (e.g. Universalism vs Nationalism). I'm saying that many ""Fascists"" find common grounds with social welfare democracy and communism in their pushes for class egalitarianism, you haven't properly refuted that point. 

&gt; That's why almost all of the criticisms from the Right are ignored. If you're going to criticize someone pick a specific criticism and stick to it. Oftentimes it seems like the Right are throwing scary words at the wall and seeing what will stick.

Antagonistic comments like this, are they really necessary? It's not much different than leftists accusing neoliberal parties such as UKIP, Tories, or the G.O.P. as being ""fascist"". The left is much quicker to throw pejorative terms around than the right is. ",askaconservative,t5_2vg6d,-5.0,

Everytime they went to see Wilhelm, they brought an audio recorder so they could listen to him prophecying and make sense of it later on.

But on that fateful day, April 13, 1921, Wilhelm bore witness to something so terrifying, he was unable to do anything but scream.

Sadly, Wilhelm had to be committed to the Beverly Hills Home for the Cinematically Insane soon after. Hollywood mourned the loss of one of their greatest assets and honored him by taking that recorded scream and placing into movies. For every movie that the scream was used in, Wilhelm and his family got a check every time that movie was aired or rebroadcast, because back then, Hollywood protected its own.

Just before his death in 1971, there was a call from the Home. Wilhelm had woken up and was lucid. He was calling for the heads of the studios to meet with him one last time.

When they arrived, the studio heads asked Wilhelm what he saw that scared him so much. He told them he could not say the name, as it would bring the screaming back. But he would write it down.

As he wrote however, his heart gave out and the message was unfinished. The only thing he had managed to write was ""Beware M. Nigh...""",ExplainLikeImCalvin,t5_2sp85,10.0,

Personally I'm well past taking the assertions of the news author and look to the study, with a decent understanding of what scientific studies are attempting to do and the reality of statistics. I guess I have a way of assuming that other readers do the same, at least in an environment like the science subreddit.

The double-edged sword of scientific studies is they boil questions down to single-variable problems that are testable, re-testable, shareable between other researchers, etc. Because science is based on the formulation of hypotheses, the testing of those hypotheses with well-structured and repeatable experiments, and then the repeating of those experiments for confirmation. But real issues in the real world are complex, multi-variable things which require the human intuition to look at many studies, many facets, posit reasonable guesses, check for logical consistencies, and understand the system at work. Evaluating complex multi-variable system honestly leaves the realm of direct ""science"", but if such hypothesized systems are likely to be correct, then single-variable scientific studies will confirm aspects of that system and/or be consistent with how the system works with itself. Science is a tool far more than it is a creator of answers; the answers are created by the creatures that ask the questions: human beings. So if you were so philosophically inclined, you could dismiss the entirety of science as confirming the reality we built ourselves, but that's not very practical is it? It's certainly not something the empiricists would get on board with!

When I got mine, I was at a bar one night and had too much to drink. I called a cab to pick me up. When it got there, I had him stop by my car so I could grab my laptop bag that I didn't want to leave out overnight. There was a cop in the parking lot already, but I didn't think anything of it. He came racing over and busted me for DUI because I was ""in control of a vehicle"" even though I was only grabbing a backpack out and it was blocked in the parking spot by my cab. 

I ended up having to take several weeks of alcohol abuse classes among other things, because anyone who has more than one drink at a time has a problem apparently. During the classes we covered different cases of people getting DUIs and what could get you in trouble. Obviously don't drink and drive. But don't be in your front yard with your car keys on you if you've had a drink. If you're within a certain distance of the vehicle you're still in control of the vehicle. Don't drink a beer on a hot day while mowing your lawn, a mower is a vehicle. One guy got a DUI while trying to fix his car in his driveway. The engine didn't start, but he was drinking a beer while working on it. One old woman got a DUI after church because someone hit her and the communion wine registered on the breathalyzer as a .01 and she had a grandkid with her. That one was a felony because of the kid. Another person got a DUI after leaving a hospital and driving too slowly. She told the cop she was tired after working a double shift then visiting her sick mother. You can get a DUI if the cop thinks you're too tired, and she got her 2nd DUI that way even though she had nothing in her system.

- Two cities = more science because they can grow freely and the more cities you get the more science you'll need to get techs. Two cities (Capital + free settler from liberty) Allow you to get all your tiles improved by workers. It also help you to not care about happiness because you'll have just two cities. Two cities is the best way to rush some tech and an early army to take one or two Ais before renaissance era. More cities make it harder and in the late game it doesn't make a real difference... In my opinion.

- I'm one of the best not the best I don't think you can be the best at that game. By this I mean I'm one of those that can win deity. When you read the definition of ""deity"" in civ it says : only the best player will succeed or something like this. I say ""one of the best"" instead of a deity player.

- Random policies because I can win deity with piety and dodge rationalism. I can win deity with any kind of policies because it's not what make you win the game, of course you can try hard, I did try hard when I made my let's play as mongolia, I won the game (7ais) before entering industrial era, didn't even get the chance to really pick policies, but that's what make the game interesting and fun, it's to play all policies and strategies.

- Go wide early, build 4 cities and go tradition, I bet you two cookies that with my one city in liberty and my Great scientist I'll get my keshiks, berzerker, samurai, camel archer etc... before you and I'll end the game quicker. Maybe you can, but I'd love to know how you do it cause I can't. The huns is one of the rare rush civ, I do go to war really early with them, that's why I go liberty, no time to waste in cities and settler I spam tons of units and take two capitals, it's better to get two capitals and have on city than three cities. (Let's remember that we are talking only about domination game here and that you win it by taking capitals.)

- You already took two capitals before renaissance era or in it with tradition? I can't I tried and I never saw anyone doing it in brave new world... Liberty is great for one city rush science and wide. You can't win through domination with tradition and waiting indusrial era, unless you aren't playing on standard and you play england on a sea map. If you can I'm curious to see it.

- I can win deity with the iroquois through domination, as I can with poland, so for me it's balance, it's easier with poland maybe, it's more fun with the iroquois. What matter it's the end and at the end you can win with all civs.

- Sweden? Get everyone friendly and enjoy 50-70% or more great people generation. You'll go to space quickly like this or maybe win diplo before info era because all CS are your allied because it's easy to get them allied. Beside the fact sweden is strong, what make them the best civ in the game for me is : They are fucking fun to play. You basically just go to war and get all city states allied with you by doing this, never have to worry about culture, faith or happiness, you'll also be able to get a lot of UU, i had camel archer, longbowman and samurai in one game once.

Progression would be based on A) learning to use werewolf abilities, and B) regular human skills.  The player gets to choose whether they focus on their human or wolf side more, or even trying to balance both.

The NPCs would have proper AI that lets them react to events in the world, based on a knowledge system that tracks what every person knows (or believes they know, if they were deceived or mistaken).  The main story would progress dynamically based on the actions you take, and I mean that literally.  It wouldn't be ""choose A or B"", but rather you'd have a bunch of different people and werewolves that you can chose to help or hurt, and they react accordingly.  The world would also be dynamic, with events occurring constantly (like werewolf attacks, hunting parties, or even human-on-human or wolf-on-wolf raids between different factions) that the player can choose to take a side in or just sit and watch as they see fit.

Ideally, the player should be able to do what every they want, whether that's being a friendly neighborhood werewolf, a hunter-of-his-own-kind driven by vengeance, a brutal monster that strikes terror in people, or whatever else they see fit.  Their actions should help shape the world as well, e.g. by having the groups they help get stronger, and perhaps even changing their opinions on werewolves depending on how the player acts.

P16: Well that's a stare that's bound to give me nightmares for a while. Sorry Jimmy, Young Michelle. You both lose. The ex-harpy wins creepiest face 2014.

P17: The comments section cover the issue quite comprehensively. Anthony is understandable in his anger. He's been lied to his whole life and is getting the (highly unexpected) consequences of it now. It's quite possible that he's stuck like this because of the choices of his mother and Blanche's honesty.

P18: Yet, they told him with the best of intentions. I hope when Anthony moves on, he'll come to peace with his mother and Blanche (and by proxy, his mother). I just feel bad for all of them. Such a terrible situation. :(",skindeepcomic,t5_303jq,1.0,

The rotation is fun and it's not always the same, it's not consistent like most are, it changes depending on procs and that affects how your cooldowns line up so there's a lot of mixup going on.

Not sure how BM plays but I find MM very boring, though I believe it's #1 spec for singletarget. MM is basically casting Chimaera Shot on cooldown, spamming Steady Shot until you can Aimed Shot, rinse and repeat.

Survival also has you thinking a lot about how much focus you can use, you have to know if you'll have enough focus when Explosive Shot and Black Arrow comes off cooldown, so depending on that you need to Cobra Shot or dump with Arcane Shot. MM is usually easy in that way, you almost never focus starve.",wow,t5_2qio8,2.0,

Some shit ain't made to be fixable, but yea they definitely should have called you and told you whats up immediately when they found out.

* A big fancy house for yourself, of course. I have a castle in my spawn town, some nice apartments in my desert city and mining colony, and a big waterfront mansion in my harbor town. Working on adding a personal airship for the desert city: I just repurposed the lighthouse into a docking tower, and have been collecting wood and wool for the gasbag and gondola...

* A pleasant waterfront district, if you're close enough to navigable waterways: think marinas, waterfront parks, bridges, eateries, fountains, etc.

* Since it's a mountain build, you can add heaps of bridges and tunnels, and maybe some terraced neighborhoods.

* Commercial infrastructure, 'cause folks gotta work! Decide whether it'll be a farming town, mining town, manufacturing center, trade hub, and so on, and build according to that idea.

* The obligatory [Absurdly Spacious Sewer](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySpaciousSewer), and maybe a [Creepy Cathedral](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCathedral). I like having a ""dungeon"" of sorts in or near town: one of my towns includes a walled-off haunted cathedral (no lights, an underground Creeper temple, and connections to a network of tunnels under the city), while another one has extensive sewers that feed into an underground ravine system that leads all the way down to bedrock.
