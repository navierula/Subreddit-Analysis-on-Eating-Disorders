 [**Brutalist architecture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist%20architecture): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Brutalist architecture__ is a movement in architecture that flourished from the 1950s to the mid-1970s, descended from the [modernist architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_architecture) movement of the early 20th century. The term does not derive from the word ""brutal"", but originates from the French *béton brut*, or ""raw concrete"", a term used by [Le Corbusier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier) to describe his choice of material. [British architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_United_Kingdom) critic [Reyner Banham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reyner_Banham) adapted the term into ""brutalism"" (originally ""New Brutalism"") to identify the emerging style.

&gt;Brutalism became popular with governmental and institutional clients, with numerous examples in Britain, France, Germany, Japan, the United States, Canada, Brazil, the Philippines, and Australia. Examples are typically massive in character (even when not large), [fortress-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortification), with a predominance of exposed [concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete) construction, or in the case of the ""brick brutalists"" ruggedly detailed brickwork and concrete together. There is often an emphasis on graphically expressing in the external elevations and in the whole-site plan the main functions and people-flows of the buildings. Brutalism became popular for educational buildings (especially university buildings), but was relatively rare for corporate projects. Brutalism became favoured for many government projects, high-rise housing, and [shopping centres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_mall) to create an architectural image that communicated strength, functionality, and frank expression of materiality.

&gt;In its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy, Brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of some 1930s and 1940s architecture. In one critical appraisal by Banham, Brutalism was posited not as a style at all but as the expression of an atmosphere among architects of moral seriousness. ""Brutalism"" as an architectural critical term was not always consistently used by critics; architects themselves usually avoided using it altogether. More recently, ""brutalism"" has become used in popular discourse to refer to buildings of the late twentieth century that are large or unpopular – as a synonym for ""brutal"" – making its effective use in architectural historical discourse problematic.

&gt;__Welfare queen__ is a [pejorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative) phrase used in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America) to refer to people, usually women, who are accused of collecting excessive [welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_(financial_aid\)) payments through fraud or manipulation. Reporting on welfare fraud began during the early 1960s, appearing in general interest magazines such as *[Readers Digest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers_Digest)*. The term entered the American [lexicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon) during [Ronald Reagan's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan) [1976 presidential campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States\)_presidential_primaries,_1976) shortly after he described [a woman abusing welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Taylor) from [Chicago's South Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Side_(Chicago\)), but he never used the term ""welfare queen"" when referencing the woman.

&gt;

&gt;A __pole of inaccessibility__ marks a location that is the most challenging to reach owing to its remoteness from [geographical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography) features that could provide access. Often it refers to the most distant point from the coastline. The term describes a geographic construct, not an actual physical phenomenon. Subject to varying definitions, it is of interest mostly to [explorers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explorer).

 [**Winged scapula**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged%20scapula): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;A __winged scapula__ (__scapula alata__) is a condition in which the shoulder blade, or shoulder bone, protrudes from a person’s back in an abnormal position. It is a rare condition with the potential to lead to limited functional activity in the upper extremity to which it is adjacent. It can affect a person’s ability to lift, pull, and push weighty objects. In some serious cases, the ability to perform [activities of daily living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living) such as changing one’s clothes and washing one’s hair may be hindered. The name of this condition comes from its appearance, a wing-like resemblance, due to the [medial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomical_terms#Anatomical_directions) border of the [scapula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_blade) sticking straight out from the back. Scapular winging has been observed to disrupt [scapulohumeral rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapulohumeral_muscles), contributing to decreased [flexion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion) and [abduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_(kinesiology\)) of the upper extremity, as well as a loss in power and the source of considerable pain.  A winged scapula is considered normal posture in young children, but not older children and adults.
