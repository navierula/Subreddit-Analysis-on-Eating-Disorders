R123456710,"First of all, you're not ugly at ALL. The pic with you in the suit is very flattering. I would say the first and last pics make your face look a bit wider at the bottom, it may just be the angle, try taking selfies from a point higher up and farther away. In the second pic, your smile is beautiful. I think all you need is a bit more confidence and you'll have girls flocking towards you no problem. To be honest, I'm not gonna say I don't know what you're talking about when you mentioned the anorexia analogy. For a large part of my life, I've always been super insecure about my appearance, to the point where I hated people looking at me. I remember sitting in business class one day wishing I had a paper bag I could put over my face just so people wouldn't be offended by my looks. It wasn't till this year that my biology teacher recommended I see a social worker and counsellor due to my self esteem issues (I had an emotional break down right in front of him). But anyways, the point of my little anecdote is that despite my super low self esteem and my personal view of myself, people don't actually see me the way I see myself. I even made a post here to ask strangers what they think of me (you can check it out if you want), and to my surprise people actually said I'm pretty. So chin up, you're not as bad as you think. It may be hypocritical of me to say this, but you shouldn't over analyze yourself so much. Next time you look in the mirror, look at the attractive man you are, not the ugly man your mind thinks you are. Overall, I'd give you a 7-7.5/10. With a nice smile and better camera angle, maybe a little stubble, I would give you an 8-8.5/10.

"&gt; Men, Women and Children follows the story of a group of high school teenagers and their parents as they attempt to navigate the many ways the internet has changed their relationships, their communication, their self-image, and their love lives. The film attempts to stare down social issues such as video game culture, anorexia, infidelity, fame hunting, and the proliferation of illicit material on the internet. As each character and each relationship is tested, we are shown the variety of roads people choose - some tragic, some hopeful - as it becomes clear that no one is immune to this enormous social change that has come through our phones, our tablets, and our computers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nirachi," It's not unusual for a person on an extreme diet or exercise program to have a compromised immune system. The lifestyle changes utilized to facilitate such a large amount of weight loss are not always healthy, even if the end results are aesthetically pleasing.

dream_in_rainbows,"When I was eighteen my family and I were traveling home from a wedding and made a stop in Kansas. The rest stop had a rock as a decoration and I decided to jump off of the rock. I ended up breaking both of my feet and my left ankle. Completely destroyed them. I had surgery on both feet and the left ankle to fix the major breaks, and then a year later another surgery, and the year after that a third surgery. Total over all that I spent 23 weeks in a wheelchair. Wheelchairs, walkers, and canes were the only ways I could get around. I was told I would never walk without pain again, I would never run, or be anywhere near as active as I was.    It absolutely destroyed me, I began doing nothing but sitting around and eating. I got up to to 225 pounds, when I was able to walk without any aids, I was still miserable and in pain.    One day I decided enough of that and decided to lose weight. It began as a diet, but then food anxiety and restriction took over. I got down to 121 pounds, and was diagnosed with anorexia last year, I can run again, and my ankle or feet no longer hurt, unfortunately now my hands go numb, they're are a shade of purple from lack of circulation, I've lost bone density, I've had three heart attack scares, a surgery to remove my gallbladder and I'm severely malnourished.

Elwetritsch,"I hope i can state it in such a respective way that this topic deserves, please bear in mind I'm not a native English speaker: I think it might be a little short sighted to brush it of as if your husband doesn't care. Your daughter has some things to deal with and its great that she'll seek help with that. There are things in her life that bring her to manipulating her feelings by means of food. Having dealt with bulemia and anorexia for the greater part of my life there's one thing i can confidently say: in dealing with eating disorders IMHO it should best be avoided focusing on eating itself and food but accept that the disorder is merely a tool, a method of self regulating emotions. My personal opinion is that behavioral therapy is the place to focus on, the input / output of food might be better focused on if serious health issues exist and if not accompany BT. Nevertheless: I just want to point out the maybe very, very minimal chance that your husband also has an issue with dealing with his emotions and is just unable to cope with it on his own and his method of coping isn't food but sticking to a allegedly ""perfect"" image of his family and especially his daughter..

It's been bad enough lately that I've considered asking to be put back on them, but part of the reason I came off them is because I want to have kids one day (catch 22 though, because at the moment I feel too crazy to have kids so it's certainly not something that will happen in the short term)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Try it on for size: Depression is *thinking* a lot about things so much that it's debilitating to actually *do* things (and the contents of those thoughts are usually of an unhappy nature). ADD is thinking a lot of different things in a short amount of time. Eating disorders often involve thinking about food more (bulimia and anorexia) or less (anorexia; or at least that's what they called it when I had it) than the average person thinks about what they eat. Stuttering is thinking so many things at once that you can't *say* anything...and then thinking about how frustrating it is that you can't say things...and then thinking more...and being more frustrated... OCD is thinking so much about a particular thing you're doing that you find it impossible to think about (let alone do) anything else until that one thing is done a certain way. Synesthesia, although it may not be considered ""disorderly"" is making associations between things that most other people don't. Social anxiety is overthinking social situations to the point of fearing them. PTSD is thinking a lot about a particular (traumatic) experience you had, such that you cannot think about or do other things. Bipolar: thinking a lot of positive things at once and then thinking a lot of negative things at a completely separate time, and not being able to control when.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Your body, needs all sorts of nutrients, and your fat cells are how the body stores those nutrients for later. Being a little larger than the norm is not a bad thing. It is when you are taking up the space of two people on the bus is when you need to reconsider your size. Otherwise, focus more on keeping your muscles toned with some semi-regular exercise, drink less super sugary substances, and for fuck sakes people stop consuming fake sugars/ syrups. Those last two things are some of the biggest contributors  to over sized people. It does two things. It gives them the idea that they can drink that diet cola and eat two pizza's and the bucket of chicken instead of just a normally healthy sized meal with a glass of water or heaven forbid a cup of tea. The second thing it does is that it tricks your body. Your body has no fucking clue what to do with those sugars. But it knows what to do with sugar, which it is tricking your body to believe it is, so your body stores it for use later, since you already have a sufficient blood sugar level to begin with. This, is the biggest reason why diet colas seem to contribute more to weight gain than weight loss.

Too much lean meat or carbs for that matter can lead to something known as rabbit famine. Most commonly seen in societies that focus on lean and super lean foods.

beatlefloydzeppelin,"Anorexia is just a symptom caused by something else. It sounds like you have some anxiety issues, and maybe some depression from time to time. Both of these can definitely cause anorexia. But it could also be something less obvious like zinc deficiency or Crohn's disease. And (I don't mean to scare you because it is unlikely) it can also be a sign of something more serious like cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"But it is impossible to make any progress unless you find the root cause. May I ask why do dislike our ""current diagnostic system?"" I understand that some people are cautious with drugs and medication (as they should be) but a diagnosis is just the process of finding the cause of a persons symptoms. You don't have to take any medicine that they prescribe, do any of the tests they recommenced, and in fact you can completely ignore their advice if you want to. But getting an opinion of someone who has spent their entire life studying humans and medicine can never hurt, especially when the recovery process might only involve some simple lifestyle changes and some therapy (talking is about as natural as it gets). So once again, I would recommend seeing a doctor, even if you don't follow their advice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've seen girls battling anorexia - they are completely pale, emaciated, and cannot stand of walk for long periods of time. When they're hospitalized they're grouped with the old people as fall risks and they have to be fed through a tube, because if you feed them too much to fast their stomach will literally explode. It's a devastating illness that leaves sufferers with lasting consequences. And hams will completely disregard their struggle because they're skinny. I hate how these fat fucks giggle and smile about being fat while my friend from high school was already under 100 lbs when she developed an eating disorder and she couldn't stand looking in the mirror despite having a great body.

"I developed anorexia at 16. I was undiagnosed bipolar, and was instead diagnosed with unipolar depression. Putting someone who is bipolar strictly on SSRI's typically is a very bad thing. So I felt emotionally out of control. To gain control and also fueled by intense self hate, I unfortunately found out anorexia could ""solve"" my problems. I'm 5'10 and began at a healthy weight of 160lbs. Within months I dropped to 127lbs. I began treatment for a suspected eating disorder. I began eating and flipped out. I began to self induce vomiting. I was diagnosed with purging anorexia. My weight fell to 112lbs. I was literally dying. My pulse would fall into the 20's when I slept. I could barely walk any distance. I had no fat, almost no muscle left, my body was ravaged. I was offered a bed in an inpatient eating disorder treatment center. I refused, and even though I was a minor, my parents didn't force me to go. So I gained weight a bit. To make a long story short I developed bulimia, which I believed caused more damage than my anorexia. I gained a lot of weight - as is typically with bulimia. I also began self injuring at 16. The two addictions go back and forth. Both may be present but when one disappears the other comes back with a vengeance.

I started abusing my pain medication from Lupus and fybermialgia to keep me awake. I stayed awake without food for a week give or take at a time. I passed out from exhaustion flat on my face on my tile floor and woke up a bloody mess. I'm blessed I'm not dead from an overdose or from collapsing.

They would likely bring back your appetite, which would allow you to eat, bring back some of your self-esteem, which would help with the actual illness.

Quietuus,"I've done a fairly large amount of research on the issue myself, but I come to it from a more political and social issues stance. There are enough dissenting voices, ill-fitting data and deficiencies in studies for me to have serious doubts about both the prevalance and effects of obesity, particularly when we talk about people at the lower end of what is now considered obese (a definition category which has expanded quite dizzily over the last 20-30 years). I also seriously worry that particularly for a lot of people in this lower band (or those trying to avoid it) the mental and physical toll wrought by body image issues and haphazard attempts to control weight is going to do more damage than weight. One factor that we know exacerbates almost every other health condition and shortens the human life span is stress. Anywhere from 10-20 million plus Americans (depending on which figures you look at) suffer from eating disorders, a number which is growing. The long term and short term health effects of anorexia nervosa particularly are extremely serious; much worse than being somewhat overweight. I mean, it kills 15-20% of the people who have it according to long-range studies. Bulimia and other eating disorders are nice only by comparison. I also worry to what extent our cultural dialogues against fat produce medical harm; I'm sure if you've researched the issue you'll probably have come across the papers about how people who are considered overweight tend to access medical care less, how they are overdiagnosed or underdiagnosed certain conditions, how they are given the wrong doses for medication, refused treatment (and in the US refused health insurance) more often (often for little good clinical reason) and so on. I believe that these are inevitable consequences of treating obesity as an epidemic disease; as is the exaggerated fear of contagion you often see in reddit fat-haters, who seem to fear that those who would try and live with fat (particularly) are some sort of diabolical social cancer. Fat isn't contagious, it's not an illness to be fought with the efficiency of a military campaign; it's a very visible (and somewhat erratic) single indicator of health, diet and so on. The decision to treat it as an epidemic, to highlight its dangers, to focus on *this* problem specifically over so many others (particularly less visible problems like mental health generally) seems to me to be obviously a political matter. The treatment of fat people as sufferers from an epidemic disease tends to enable their dehumanisation, both in terms of the medical profession and ultimately in terms of subs like /r/fatpeoplehate.",Negareddit,t5_2vsbl,2,446,75.17,61.48,22,1,34.31,24.22,88.57,50,11.21,4.71,2.24,0.9,0.9,0,0.67,6.5,6.5,15.7,6.73,7.62,7.17,0.45,12.56,7.85,3.59,2.91,2.02,3.59,6.95,1.35,5.61,1.57,0.67,0.9,6.5,0,0,0,0,15.25,3.14,2.69,1.12,5.16,2.69,2.69,1.79,1.12,0.22,0.45,9.64,1.35,8.52,0,3.81,7.62,1.35,0.9,2.69,0.67,2.02,0.9,10.09,0.45,9.42,0.9,6.28,2.24,2.02,0.45,0,0.22,0,0.9,0.67,0,0.45,0,0,0,14.57,2.91,3.14,0,0.9,0,0,1.35,0,1.57,3.59,1.12

"A little off-topic, but when I was hospitalized a loooong time ago, a friend in the hospital with bi-polar and anorexia was given ECT.  She was moved to a different hospital so I didn't see her right afterwards, but I saw her a couple years later.  She was way more confident, no longer 85 lbs. and seemed generally happy.  She was still on Lithium at the time, but said that the ECT had helped snap her into shape where the meds started working.

shirafoo,"Hoo boy. I had pretty severe anorexia as a teenager, and my mom was a big contributor to my downward spiral because of her commenting and so on - and she was NOWHERE near this bad. Your husband has been an utter jackass, and you need to make him understand that any way you possibly can. Get it into his head that eating disorders are DEADLY and that there is NO EXCUSE for a grown person to tell a vulnerable teenage girl anything remotely resembling ""you're fat"". MUCH LESS when that person is supposed to be someone who loves her. You tell him that she is his daughter, and he needs to be kind to her, that she is especially vulnerable at this age to becoming overly critical of her body and that there is enough pressure on her to look a certain way as is. The most important thing is that your child is healthy and happy, and you need to stress how imperative it is that he agrees with this.

If he won't change and you can't leave him without making things worse for her, that means it is up to you to pick up the slack and make up for every bad thing he says to her about her body. I have always been grateful to my brother for defending me to my mom when she made her comments and telling her off (unfortunately he didn't live at home so he couldn't always do this). I told her off too, as your daughter has done, but it's one thing to shout ""I'm not fat! Look at yourself!"" as a hurt teenager to the parent, and another entirely to hear an older member of that family stick up for you. He would say things clearly like ""Mom, I think you need to think about the way you are talking to your teenage daughter right now."" Letting her know not just that she was wrong about my body but also wrong to comment at all. This is what you need to continue doing. If he makes a comment, you refute that comment and you let her know that his opinion is NOT supported.

She may resent you a bit, but if some adult had just fucking NOTICED what I was going through at that age and INSISTED upon doing something about it I would have struggled to get around it, but I have no doubt that if I'd gotten some therapy at that time it would have saved me A LOT of the physical harm I did my body. People disagreeing with my mom and telling me ""your not fat"" was nice an all, and quite a few of my peers noticed my weightloss and voiced some concerns (albeit not usually in a very constructive way), but not one single adult spoke to me about it, and I wish that they had.

Your daughter probably understands this too, but it's still there in her head and it's still going to affect her. You need to help her and counteract this, and you need to encourage her to get some therapy and you need to underline the importance of good nutrition, of eating for health not for appearances, of taking care of herself and of loving her body. You mentioned that she is fit and plays sports, so you need to emphasize how great her fitness is, and make sure that she eats well and is healthy. Talk to her openly, let her know she can tell you her feelings, that you love her and that you are a trustworthy adult that she can confide in.

_____1_____2_____3,"Lowest BMI was 15. I'm naturally on the curvy side, between hourglass and pear. When my eating disorder first began to manifest, I was restricting a bit, then purging once or twice a day which caused me to become depressed. My mom noticed something was wrong and read my journal (I had just turned 12 at that point). I convinced her that I was totally fine and it was just a phase. She thought I was too young to have an eating disorder. She offered to take me to counseling but I said no. I got better at hiding it. When the school year started, I turned to serious restricting and exercising. I lost a lot of weight very quickly, was freezing and exhausted all the time, and my hair was falling out in clumps. I was wearing a lot of extra layers of clothes, both to keep warm and to hide my figure. My mom didn't realize how much weight I had lost until I passed out in the shower and she found me. Thus began me getting help: she took me to my pediatrician, who sent me to the state eating disorder specialist. I was diagnosed with anorexia and then hospitalized for the first time for dramatic weight loss, malnutrition, and heart problems. So basically I was forced to get help for years because I was a minor. It wasn't until I was 19 that I decided to take things seriously and pull myself out of the rut.",casualiama,t5_2sxwp,3,250,41.25,15.86,94.87,2.02,15.62,16.8,90.8,56,18.8,14.8,12.8,0,0,2,0,4,5.6,12.4,8,4.8,8.8,1.2,19.2,3.2,0.8,2,2.8,2.8,5.2,1.2,4,0,0,2,5.6,0.8,0,2.8,0,9.6,3.6,2,0.4,1.6,0.8,1.6,2.4,0,0.4,2,6,1.2,2.4,0,2.8,8.4,0.8,2.4,2,2.8,2,12.8,3.2,0.8,15.2,2.8,4.8,8,1.2,0.8,0.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.8,6.4,4,0.4,0,0,0,0,0,1.2,0.8,0

"In middle school, there was very little more that I wanted than to sit at the popular kidsí table. I never did. I was average. I played soccer and basketball, but I usually started on the bench.

"When I was in 7th grade, I watched a TV movie about eating disorders. Because it was made for TV and wasnít a boring health video, it didn't talk about the health consequences or the nitty-gritty of the disorder. Instead, it glorified eating disorders and made it seem like something one could do for 3 months and then soon get over. It intrigued me. It was the exact thing I was looking for. I had tried other versions of self-harm, but none of those provided me the relief I craved. Nobody could see how much I was hurting, and they needed to know. So that day, at Target with my mom, I decided to refuse the smoothie she bought. I was hungry, and I wanted a sip of that smoothie so bad, but that day, I decided to change my life. That day, in that very instant, I decided that I needed to control my life, and I felt that the best way to do that was to control my eating habits.

I knew weight loss was a symptom of depression, so I convinced everyone that I lost my appetite because I wasnít happy. They put me on anti-depressants and thought that would cure me. What they didnít know was that I was starving at all times. One day at my friendís house, I ate some trail mix. I couldnít stop thinking about the calories in the mix, so I went upstairs and purged the food. I started purging at school, at home, and in restaurants. Fortunately, my friends recognized what was going on and decided to write a letter to my mom (who worked at my high school) and put it in her mailbox. After about a week, I got called into my assistant principalís office and was met by my principal and parents. They had a bag packed and said I was leaving right then, in the middle of my 9th grade year, to go to inpatient treatment at an eating disorder hospital. I was angry, but I also was excited. I thought that maybe ñ just maybe ñ I would be able to find my way out of this eating disordered hell. When I got to my very first inpatient stay, I was 82 pounds, and my blood pressure was 76/32. I remember that number exactly because I truly believed I was going to die. Unfortunately, that wasnít enough to scare me into helping myself. Soon into my stay, I had to sleep in front of the nursesí station because they caught me exercising in my room. I asked one of the girls that was only there 12 hours a day to buy me diet pills and laxatives. I was still a slave to my anorexia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I am now 24. Last summer was my 8th stay in a treatment facility. Two years ago, I missed Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Yearís, and my birthday in a 3-month residential stay. I have missed many birthdays of loved ones and family vacations, and I have missed 4 Easters. If I string together the amount of time I have spent in different treatment facilities, it totals over a year. Imagine where you were one year ago. I spent that time living away from family and friends and tackling my eating disorder. I have an arrhythmia, gastritis, acid reflux, GERD, a hernia, and osteopenia, and there is a possibility that I will never have children because I went years without my period. I wish more than anything that it didnít take me 7 years to graduate college due to medical withdrawals for treatment. I look back on the last 11 years of my life and cannot believe I wasted all of this time, energy, and money on this disease.

"But I also know that it was not my fault. Eating disorders are not about food or weight or vanity. They are a disease that people do not ask for, and they tear apart lives. Those close to me still have to deal with my eating disorder, but they do not have to worry that I will keel over and die anymore. As of last Fall, I can honestly say that I am in recovery. I am not working towards recovery, and recovery is not an abstract thought. Just last summer, I was at a residential facility in North Carolina bawling and hyperventilating because the chef poured olive oil in the rice; now I can eat hummus (with olive oil!). I have maintained a healthy body weight for longer than any other time post-treatment. I can order French fries. I ate a red velvet cupcake with cream cheese icing a few months ago and ate banana cake on my birthday -- and I kept both down. I am in the process of reversing most of the health consequences from 11 years of torturing my body, but there are some that cannot be reversed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"There is nothing in this world that I wish I could change more than the decision to not drink that smoothie at Target. I still struggle and have daily battles in my mind, but they are getting less prominent. There are some days that I struggle and give in to my eating disorder, but instead of treating that as an excuse to spiral, I can overcome those mini-battles and continue to take more steps forward than back. However, I never would be where I am today if I didnít receive help. My friends took a huge leap by writing that letter to my parents when I was in 9th grade, but they donít realize that they saved my life. I would not have stopped until I was dead. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. In fact, 20% of people suffering from anorexia will die from complications related to their eating disorder, and these deaths can come well after somebody has entered recovery. Eating disorders are an addiction, a compulsion, an obsession, and a slow (or sometimes quick) suicide. They are not a diet or a joke, and they will ruin your life. I was lucky to make it out alive, but I know many people who have died at the hand of their eating disorder. It is not something to be ashamed of ñ getting help shows true strength. More people are struggling than you realize, and you are not alone. An eating disorder does not mean you are broken, crazy, or weak. It means you have a disease you did not ask for, and suffering in silence is not necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Fast forward to December 2014, specifically Christmas day and I'm having a breakdown in my sister's car about life in general. I haven't done this in well over 4 years. She tells me that I've changed and that I'm a stronger person compared to who I was when I was 16. She tells me it's thanks to my brother-in-law for making me this way. For the first time since my realisation 3 years ago, I tell her that he's manipulated her into believing that bullying me is good for me. You know what she says? ""Bullying is good for you. It made you a stronger person!"" I say ""well then why do I feel weaker?!"" She tells me that when I was 16 I was crazy emotional and she was scared that I'd self-harm or slit my wrists or something. She has no idea that before I met the guy I didn't self-harm at all. I only started self-harming  after they married. I don't mean to say that he's the main trigger for my self-harm, but if he had never started bullying me than my eating disorder wouldn't be as bad as it is now and my mental health wouldn't have deteriorated so much. The reason I feel so weak today is because he stole my sister's faith in me and replaced it with the belief that she has to have faith in him bullying me because that's what it takes to make me a stronger person. Even she's joined in on the bullying. I can't stand her for doing that. I know it's not her fault because manipulators be manipulators, and she's just the victim of one, but I wish she'd just listen to me and stop it because it has made me start resenting her which is in turn making her resent me.

It was tough at the start, I had to have a ng tube, and before I started eating regular food, I moved onto things that we call Ensure in the UK, they are basically drinks or yogurts with a high energy content (I try not to think about the calorie content) so that you are able to work on the other things around you and be able to think clearly without being extremely hungry and malnourished. When I finally moved onto normal food, it was tough, really tough. But I got through it with one to one meal supports at every meal in the hospital and even when I was discharged.

"My senior year of high school, I developed anorexia. I was eating 1200 calories a day at most and exercised obsessively. It was miserable- I was cold all the time, and food and calories were constantly on my mind. Finally I reached my goal weight, but as soon as I got to college something inside me snapped: I began binging at almost every meal, to the point that I was painfully full every time I ate. I felt so guilty and still was obsessing over everything I put in my mouth, but I couldn't stop eating all the foods I had deprived myself of for so long! I gained almost fifty pounds in the space of just a few months, which was pretty traumatic. None of my clothes fit anymore, and I hated myself for gaining all the weight back. But I was unable to get the binging under control, and soon I developed bulimia. I struggled with bulimia for almost two years, my weight going up and down every few months.

"As you can see, that was a pretty rough period in my life. But finally this past summer I decided to take control and get things back on track! I did Weight Watchers online for a few months and dropped about 10 lbs, which boosted my self-confidence in such a big way. Although I don't know if I would recommend it to anyone who has struggled with anorexia, since the ""points"" system was a little too close to my former obsessive calorie counting. However, it did teach me to be satisfied on less food, and it was great that I could eat as many fruits and veggies as I wanted! I think that really helped me with my binging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"But what has really changed my life these past couple months has been intuitive eating- no weight loss plan, just listening to my body and eating what makes me feel good. I have also been working out about 5 days a week (30 mins cardio, 30 mins weight exercises), which has helped me to tone up. But it feels so good to eat whatever I want again- even dessert (sometimes multiple times a day!) And even though switching to intuitive eating was scary at first, I haven't gained weight and my relationship with food has improved immensely.

TheNerdist,"I was very overweight as of last summer: 6' 1"" 240 lbs... I didn't feel good at all about my self. SO I started a intense work out regiment and a strict diet. I grew stronger and stronger every day and by Christmas I was 190 lbs and in pretty good shape, I was addicting to the gym. By June I was 155 lbs of 9% body fat, I was everything I wanted to achieve. But it all started to go down hill. It started off with my parents getting a divorce, it made me not want to eat, drink, or socialize. As I loss my new Identity I fell into a deeper depression, every day I grew weaker and weaker and my brain grew a fog. Once I hit what I thought was bottom in less then a month I dropped 20 more lbs again and that's when the doctors found my tumor. They did not know what it was at first: If it was cancerous or dangerous but they knew they needed to take it out ASAP. This additional stress and soon to be lack of working out hindered my mind even more. This is where I went to the doctors again, weighing a whopping 120 pounds and was noting but skin and bones. About 3 weeks after that I went to the doctors after my surgery... When I went I was diagnosed with Anorexia, something in a million years I never thought would happen to me, or even guys for that matter. I guess deep down I knew I was suffering but I didn't want to say it. My doctor told me if I kept at my current pace, I would be dead in less then a year. I did not take her seriously, in 2 more weeks I needed to be admitted into a hospital. At this time I was 106 lbs being 6' 1"" I was weak and in absolute agony. After extensive therapy I got better and better. I am a a great weight now, a tad over weight but hey its better then being months away from death. I have a solid muscle build again now and out of my mental fog. Anorexia is just as much a physical sickness as a mental one, my mental wit diapered, my cognition, my humor, and being social was poison to me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

skyscraperblue,"I'm a college student in her third year of a Mathematics degree. I started running when I was 15 purely because it was fun and sounded like a cool thing to do. Turns out making that decision saved my life. Running pulled me all the way through severe clinical depression and anorexia - some days the only thing that could get me out of bed was a run, and running teaches you about fueling fairly freaking fast, i.e. you will pass out midway through if you don't eat. Running better was the only thing I could promise myself to make myself eat for a long time during recovery. These days running keeps my sanity in check and my brain away from the dark corners, and finds new ways every day to teach me that fueling my body properly *really matters*.

DanesBeautifulMane,"Holy fuck. I don't usually comment when I disagree with something but this hits close to home for me. Please do not compare an addiction to food with anorexia. They are both their own separate issues. Anorexia is a form of mental illness that is often coupled with body dysmorphia. The person they see in the mirror isn't them, and they can't see themselves for how they truly look. They are extremely self critical and often don't seek help until someone forces it upon them. You can lose weight and overcome an addiction to food with a plan, some motivation and a willingness to better yourself. But don't tell me that someone lacks self control has the opposite of anorexia. Someone with anorexia is going to live with that for the rest of their lives and unless they stay proactive with recovery and are aware of what their triggers are they can and will relapse. You can lose weight, you can break addiction but there's no sure fire cure for mental illness. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"1. They don't know what anorexia is, and neither does most of the population. Eating disorders are mental problems, not body types. They cannot be singled out based on appearance, and occur in a small number of the population so that singling out based on appearance becomes statistically stupid to do so. I highly doubt she fainted after a 10 minute bike ride, as still being obese she would have *plenty* of reserved energy (stored fat) to get her through that. Compare that to someone who actually has anorexia nervosa and exercises two hours daily. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Setting a boundary, an expectation, and a standard for your kids is good. Enforcing them is vital as well. We learn not only from success, but from failure and disappointment. It is important to experience these things young and learn how to deal with and develop from them. Obviously not everyone is successful, but the more you are exposed in healthy ways, the better you are for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That being said. The use of food can have longer negative effects than positive. Just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should. Linking emotions and rewards or punishments to food can lead to unhealthy associations with food. I.E. Ice cream and cake when happy, getting good tasting food when good, etc. It can also have the opposite effect of having less desirable food, which to kids is usually veggies and home cooked meals vs. restaurant and fast food meals, be associated with punishment. In this case, that is evident. Father and son are eating a sandwich that probably has a lesser nutritional value and higher calorie content than the punishment food, which is leftovers. His punishment is to eat healthy. If he had done well, his reward would have been to eat unhealthy. I get the point Dad is trying to make, but the execution is misguided and aids in the creation of a bad habit, as well as instill the lesson dad is trying to teach at the same time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"When it comes to parenting, it is in my belief that certain things need to be neutral in children's lives so that they understand their needs and important uses of it. Food is high on that list. Being taught young that food and nutrition is an important part of life that is neither used as punishment or reward helps develop healthy habits later in life that help prevent obesity and health related issues. It's the same as chores. I don't see the point of giving an allowance for expected everyday chores. Those must be done regardless for health and sanitation reasons. Now, there are other things that are not in the scope of the normal everyday that kids can do to earn a little extra and helps instill a good work ethic. Those extra chores can also be used as a punishment as it doesn't conflict with the neutral installment of healthy living.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Regardless of that though, the point is to raise fully functional adults who are well adjusted to survive individually in society. Not just ""do as they are told"". Being able to obtain and maintain the basic necessities is a vital skill even in today's modern society. Some parents do get lost in the point of the lesson and forget that it needs to also be in line with the bigger picture. Intentions are great, but intentions mean nothing when weighed against actions. In this case, Dad just demonstrated that if you do good, then your reward is food of choosing, not food of need. As an adult, there is no one but you to balance those choices and most things are done out of habit. Habits are created through enforcement and repetition. Look at the US. We have an obesity problem.

Mahmoud_Imadinrjaket,There are a couple of things going on here IMHO.  The first issue is a lack of education on health/fitness in general and with that comes unrealistic goals and timelines.  The second is a body image issue which is a mental thing.  I'll address each and try to keep it brief.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"You say you've been working out for a month and a half; you my friend, have just barely even begun to start the transformation into a healthy lifestyle.  And lifestyle is the key word.  Working out and eating healthy isn't just something you do, it's a way of life.  It's all about consistency, and this sounds hard at first, but the beauty of it is once it becomes routine, you won't feel as bad when you miss a workout or eat something bad because it's the exception and not the rule.  Keep going and you WILL see and feel physical changes, and as an added bonus, your mental health will greatly improve as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Speaking of mental health.  Your feelings of self consciousness and jealousy aren't unusual.  Hell, negative body image is a huge issue in modern society.  We're constantly inundated with 'perfect' people in the media everywhere we go.  Bulimia/anorexia and depression are far too common as a result for males and females.  I'm not saying your issues are that deep, but it's coming from the same place.  Now, here's the beauty of living a healthy lifestyle.  As you become more educated and really transform your life/body, you'll start feeling much better and more confident about yourself.  Slowly, that jealousy and self consciousness will turn into respect and admiration.  Feeling like you're 'sizing' others up and having a twinge of jealousy aren't unnatural, you'll just have a better idea of what it takes to get to the level they're at and as I said will turn into more of a respect thing and hopefully a motivator for yourself.

"This guy had previously hung around the stoner/partying/major asswipe group of kids. (Nothing against non-asshole stoners.)  For whatever reason, they excommunicated him, or he left, or whatever. I knew him through water polo, so he decided to follow me and my friends around. They're pretty hesitant, knowing his reputation, but I convince them to just give the guy a shot. So, knowing that we all liked variations of alternative or surf rock, he decides to overcompensate by trying to become as fair away from mainstream as possible. If it has been played on the radio, it is automatically TERIBBLE in his eyes. So two or three friends of this approximately five person group are into bands like Panic! At The Disco, Fall Out Boy, blink-182, Modest Mouse, etc. Personally, I liked Fall Out Boy a lot. So naturally, he harassed anyone who said that they were a good band, insisting that everyone who didn't listen to Celtic metal had to have terrible taste in music- INCLUDING a girl he wanted to sleep with. Not that big of a deal to want to sleep with someone in high school, right? Wrong. This girl was a super diligent student, really caring, very innocent, and covered up any pains she had by being nice to everyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Enter asshole friend, who begins asking me to try to set them up for a date. I politely inform him I've actually had feelings for her for the past two years, and am pursuing a relationship with her. He appears to understand and backs off. After I set up my plans to ask her to homecoming and ask for his help, one of our mutual friends got uncomfortable and pulled me aside, informing me that best friend over there had already asked her behind my back and they were dating now. One argument later and I went home, feeling sick to my stomach. However, after talking to said girl, she says nothing of the kind happened. I confronted my friend about it, and his plan was revealed to be to trick me into thinking that she was taken so no one else would be asking her to homecoming, therefore taking her for himself. Whatever, says me, people do crazy things for love. Up until he asks me to help him get in one of her friends pants, at which point I was infuriated. Basically ignoring the girl he claimed to be crazy about, so much so that he'd step on a friend to do it. I get pissed about it, and he says, ""fine, I won't ask her."" (Later on, he tried dating her again, but once again cut his attempts short when he decided he'd rather try to sleep with my ex girlfriend. He earned his water polo nickname Pathetic Man-Whore.) He also started bringing his Norwegian metal friends into the drama room, which is precisely where I used to go to get away from him. He couldn't stop there, oh no. He decided to invite my other ex girlfriend to come along after school. I ended up hanging out in a closet for a while waiting for her to leave, and praying that the girl who fucked me over emotionally hadn't just seen me jump into a closet. Because, you know, high school logic. At this point, most of my friends just want to be around the ""cool guy"" in the room, and my depression worsened. There are so many stories, but I think I can just leave it at his insecurities and desire to be above everyone else, which was basically the aforementioned getting me mocked for listening to the music I liked by the people who used to like the same stuff, called a girl i dated who'd had to leave to a mental hospital for anorexia and depression ""a fat whore"", coming to my house and rubbing his junk on everything in my room, trying to get in my OTHER friend's ex's pants, calling me a jealous, over sensitive dick for getting mad that he was trying to fuck a girl I used to be crazy in high school love with, more along those lines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"13-year-olds often go through that extra weight gain while they're also growing taller, and typically if diet and exercise are healthy, it all works out. In fact, that fat is important to keeping them healthy and keeping them growing. 13 is also the prime time for the development of disordered eating. The primary source of influence comes from parents (the modeling the parents show in their own eating and body image) and in comments by peers (which is rarely fun when you're 13). Then you have media influence, which presents unachievable images of ""beauty"" that can cause a child to become depressed and, even worse, obsessed with meeting those standards. I get it--you want to raise your kid healthy. This is how you don't do that:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"So this isn't about health--it's about how she looks and whether or not she will be found attractive by her male peers.

"And the bulimia comment. Christ. I've treated bulimics who were so sick they vomited blood and had diarrhea at the same time. A few of them had family members who pushed laxatives on them to help ""take off some of those pounds!"" at the age of 14. Please note, I'm not saying families cause eating disorders. There are family factors that contribute to how they are maintained, but typically it's an epigenetic phenomenon that causes imbalances of certain neurotransmitters and hormones, but when it manifests specifically as an eating disorder there simply have to be environmental factors involved that contribute to behaviors.

"EDIT: and I know this long but hang in--the thinspiration and pro-ana stuff is just the tip of the iceberg. The quicker someone gets into therapy the shorter the recovery will be. I think it's great that she's going to therapy--the family needs to all to family therapy together, too, because anorexia and bulimia are family problems.

andapacketofcrisps,"I think that it's not uncommon for people who restrict food to wind up bingeing either during recovery or in between periods of restricting. There's actually a binge-eating subtype of anorexia, which doesn't necessarily involve purging (tons of info will come up if you Google it). I don't know how much that has to do with societal pressure, though. Maybe it's easier for the brain to transition between different disordered ways of eating than it is to build a healthy relationship with food and cure the underlying mental issues.

"That said, there is a difference between overeating and binge eating disorder (BED). BED is when you feel compelled to eat everything in sight, often to the point of severe discomfort. You barely taste anything, you don't enjoy it, you just have to keep eating. Binges don't last all day, though, or even happen every day. They're a response to anxiety and a desire to dissociate. It's a miserable feeling. Overeating is when you just eat too much, either for one meal or regularly. A lot of Americans overeat on holidays, for example. Regular overeating is how you end up eating 3,000+ calories a day (or even just a couple hundred more than you need, which is how people let the pounds creep on as they age). Both are unhealthy behaviors, but you don't have to have BED to be obese.",fatpeoplehate,t5_2x9xz,9,242,55.4,56.57,34.41,14.38,16.13,20.25,90.91,54.55,10.74,4.96,0.83,0,3.72,0,0.41,5.79,5.79,15.7,11.16,8.68,7.02,2.48,19.42,5.79,4.13,3.31,1.65,4.96,4.13,1.65,2.48,1.65,0.41,0.41,8.26,0,0,0,0,16.12,2.48,2.07,1.24,4.55,1.65,6.61,2.07,0.41,0.41,0.83,9.92,0.83,2.89,0,8.68,3.72,0.83,0.83,2.07,0.41,0,2.07,13.64,0.83,9.92,0.83,3.72,5.37,0,0.41,1.24,0,0,0,0.41,0.41,0,0,0,0,19.42,6.2,5.79,0,0,0,0,0.41,0,4.13,2.48,0.41,

I had anorexia, then bulimia, then progressed into b.e.d. and now find myself having made a friend out of food, my body, and, most importantly, my mind. I healed myself through reading, writing, and the momentum gained through that positive focus. It was not easy. Constant redirection was required. Cognitive behavioral therapy was a fantastic tool. I countered negative thoughts with positive world actions. You sound like you are focused on moving forward. You are gaining a foundation of self that no external force can shake.

Examining fossil records is much less precise because we do not have a complete record of the events of the world.

Only when we have a truly regular standard of health in place can we start talking about how to permanently change the terrifying body image so many poor eating disordered girls (and boys) believe they have. Right now, our health as a nation is hypocritical. We do pay a lot of attention to eating disorders where people eat too little, look at the rehab programs, but there's not a lot for when people eat too much...

"Later, as food became plentiful and famine a rarity, skinny was beautiful because it meant you didn't pig out. Anorexia was also seen as a sign of faith because there was some saint who survived for years without eating out of piety. The hourglass shape became ideal with the introduction of whalebone corsets. Tightlacing meant any woman could have an hourglass shape. This means that any feminist who says that skinny women being beautiful is a ""recent thing"" would have to define ""recent"" as the Victorian era.

There were even bustles (things that made your butt look bigger by poofing out your skirt) combines with corsets and flat chests were in. In roman times, women bound their breasts to get the youthful flat look. In the 1920s, a flapper look was more rectangular, no hourglass shape. But in the Middle Ages, a big high bust with lots of cleavage was a sign of youth and virginity. There's even a difference today from the mid century and even 90s that big butts with a small waist are sexy now.

Wellbutrin is a cheap drug to get due to many generic makers.  It may not be enough to treat your ADHD for it does not block as many of the reuptake pumps on a percent basis as a stimulant does.  That said it is a great combo drug for many of the commorbidities with ADHD for it treats those and unlike the stimulants it stays in your system all the time and this provides many advantages.  For example even though the med helps the pleasure center it does it so slowly your body does not realize it and thus no euphoria.  Thus you do not get addicted to this med like the stimulants and it is used to help people quit addictions such as smoking.,ADHD,t5_2qnwb,2,356,80.57,59.99,17.74,63.04,15.48,18.54,84.55,51.97,12.36,4.21,0.56,0.56,3.09,0,0,8.15,7.58,15.73,7.02,4.21,5.9,2.25,12.92,7.02,5.62,0.84,0,4.21,5.06,3.37,1.4,0,0.28,1.12,6.74,0,0,0,0,14.33,2.25,5.62,0.28,2.25,0.84,5.06,2.53,0.28,0.56,0.56,6.18,0.28,3.93,0.28,2.25,6.18,1.4,1.97,2.53,3.09,0,1.69,11.24,0.56,7.87,0.84,4.78,2.81,1.12,0.28,0,0.28,0,0,0.28,0,0,0,0.28,0,10.11,6.46,0.28,0,0,0,0,0.28,0,0,0.56,2.53,

"I think the basis for this issue was that your initial claim of your spending sounds really unbelievable to most people. Maybe the cost of food is way cheaper in your college town, and you work way harder than most at being frugal. Also, what you consider ""eating well/healthy"" is not a diet for most of your average people. Your chosen diet is far cheaper than what most people would subsist on. Basically....while YOU might be able to afford to live/eat that way, it's really pretty far from average. Your original post sort of sounded like you thought that the amount you spent on groceries was relatively normal, and it's really not for most people. For the record, I never claimed that you couldn't live on the amount of food you were getting for the amount you were spending. I did (unnecessarily harshly) call you a liar in regards to your claims of eating ""healthy"" based on what I saw in your comment history about your diet. It really doesn't sound ""healthy"". But I have retracted that unwarranted insult. I still think that most doctors would not call that a healthy diet. Some might OK it, but it really doesn't sound ""healthy"".  Livable? Sure. Not going to cause negative impacts? Ok. But not a recommended healthy plan, I'm thinking. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rofldaf1,"Why is it not as simple as ""just eat""? From my perception of the disorder, eating would cure the issues that result from the disorder. If you're not hungry, that is a real shame, but if you abstain from food when you are so skinny that you can see the bones in your face and ribs, I have no sympathy for you. You can still eat, just because you're don't want to. Everybody knows food is vital for survival. You should eat even though you are not hungry. Just measure the calories you intake and make sure it is around 2000. If you notice weight loss, increase your calorie intake. Yes it's a shame that people with anorexia have a reduced appetite, but if you stop eating because of that despite knowing it is vital, you don't get my sympathy. I myself have gone through stressful times where I have anorexia and have abstained from eating, but I knew at the time that if I ever started losing weight I would force myself to eat, because I must.

Avoid sugar and saturated fats and focus on protein and complex carbohydrates. If you find yourself gaining too much fat tissue, just reduce or cut down the amount of olive oil (or grape seed oil) first and if that's not enough cut back the maltodextrin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"No. What you're describing is body dysmorphic disorder, not an eating disorder, and to say that they ""see an anorexic person"" isn't even an accurate phrase as anorexia is a mental problem not a weight. While weight is required for the anorexia nervosa diagnosis, just being underweight for your height/gender does not mean you are anorexic. On top of all this, if an obese person saw ""an anorexic person"" in the mirror, that would mean they believe they suffer from anorexia nervosa, which would mean they would *stop eating* instead of shoveling food into their faces.

Astroyeti,"Not necessarily. Eating disorders don't just bring maladaptive behaviors. Often, they also bring a really poorly reasoned mentality. Feel free to take what I say with a grain of salt, though. To add on to what the previous posters said: Think about it like this: that sort of behavior may not be categorized as an eating disorder until it becomes something you can't necessarily stop. Eating disorders like anorexia create this illusion of control that really doesn't exist, and unlike a diet, it can't just be dropped the next day without afterthought. E.g. they may feel guilty or anxious if they can't count calories, carbs, fat, etc. or restrict to a certain amount or type of food, where someone without an eating disorder may go back to eating like normal as though nothing happened.

Ihaveafatcat,"I feel like that would be annoying if it were any type of media though, like if your family member posted three buzzfeed articles every day, ie it's not to do with selfies but just spam, really. And yet most of the selfie criticism I see specifically mentions 'vanity' and 'narcissism' and 'DAE me generation?!'

Often I think it's a sign of low self-esteem. It's old news that we live in a world where there's more pressure than ever before to look absolutely perfect. Women especially are constantly bombarded with photoshopped, professionally-taken photos of celebrities and models, and now we have the technology to take nice photos of ourselves, and feel good about ourselves, and they call us vain? Being able to take selfies on my phone improved my self esteem more than anything else ever has. And going back to Facebook, the girl who posts the most selfies in my friends list is actually recovering from severe anorexia, and I think it's fucking awesome that she now has the confidence to post pictures of herself, when before she couldn't even look in the mirror. I just don't at all get the mindset of criticising someone for being HAPPY with how they look. Spamming up your newsfeed? Sure. But criticising them for selfies in particular...

The former were not consensual, and everyone loved them. The latter were consensual, and everyone criticised them for being too revealing, too vain, too attention-seeking.

I can definitely say she must have had some serious mental disorders, because one moment she is calm and inviting, the next one she is screaming her lungs out and crying at the same time.

Even if its baby steps, like touching something your friend has touched for x amount of seconds and resist the compulsion to wash your hands for x amount of seconds and work your way up.

cherebelle86,"I've been struggling with bulimia for around four years after gaining (what I thought was too much) weight in recovery from anorexia.  For me, it's the same emotional struggle.  Feeling out of control and so I try to control what I can.  Binging - out of control, purging - in control.  Every time I feel the urge to binge, I remind myself that despite my emotions telling me otherwise, I am in control of my binging.  When I binge, that is my choice.  Accepting that fact, helps me prevent a binge (and therefore a purge because I typically only purge after a binge).  It's not always successful but its one of the coping mechanisms that has really helped me.  I always really disliked calling a friend, go for a walk, etc because it's not helpful at midnight.

"I'm also against the idea of shaming someone for their weight.  They likely know just like you do that their weight is putting strain on organs and that they are at higher risk for (insert a TON of things).  Shaming isn't the way to make them lose weight.  You need to be motivated and food is an addiction for many.  I'm one of them.  I've been underweight, overweight, bulimic, anorexic, a work-out-aholic, a binge eater....It doesn't go away with the snap of a finger.  There usually are deep rooted issues and for me to be at a healthy weight (not under or over), I need to have sessions with a nutritionist every week.  I'm not able to do it on my own and asking for help doesn't make me weak.  I've accepted that.  Just realizing that took me a long time...But now, to add to the struggle, I have gastroparesis and Crohn's.  It's possible that I did mess up my stomach and entire digestive track with all the torture that I put it through but it's considered idiopathic for now.  I do not have diabetes (for the gastroparesis)...  So now, it's even tougher because what I have to take into account is health disorders that do affect my weight (I lost 50-60 pounds in a month and a half when first diagnosed/started getting sick.)  It's not written on my forehead that I have gastroparesis and...  So my weight fluctuates A LOT (I have a difference in size clothes of 8 sizes (30-38 jeans) in my closet.  I can wear them all in the period of a year.  When I'm wearing a 30, I'm underweight.  When I'm wearing a 38, I'm overweight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"So what is fat acceptance?!  It sounds really really simple but to me at least, it's not.  I don't want to promote a culture where I tell people that being fat and unhealthy is the norm and that it's OK so get on eating and eat the worse foods you can find...anything fried is great!  I'm not going to join the whatever they are called...National Association of Fat People and repeat the BS that they spout...that there is no conclusive research to show that fat people live unhealthier and cut their lives short, etc etc...when there are actually a TON of research that prove that it is unhealthy.  You can choose to ignore them-that's an other issues on its own...But desperate people often want to believe what they are told... ''I'm fat and dieting is hard...but these people tell me that there's no studies...''.  It's much easier to follow that than to get hit by reality and do the work.  I do think that this association should be sued (if they haven't already) because they are putting people at risk.  They are emotional enablers.  You're not a monster if you're fat.  You deserve dignity and respect.  Laughing and pointing the finger won't make someone change.  There is a human being on the inside of that body-just like inside of a thin body.  We shouldn't do acceptance but ridicule and not minding our business is another thing.  Any kid with thin parents who is fat and gets ridiculed by the parent will feel like nobody can understand them and they will eat more and more in order to try and soothe the pain.  The ridicule in this case is a big factor contributing to the obesity...  These are all things to think about when considering ''fat''.

"I had severe stomach pains eating fruit meals. When I was living in Thailand, my stomach hurt more than ever (""melon belly"" as they call it) eating all sweet fruits other than papaya, dragon fruit and mangosteen. I felt sick eating bananas (I've discovered, I think, that I'm allergic to them; stomach cramps, mouth itch, face flush, no matter how ripe.)

"I eventually started eating some cooked foods for dinner (low-fat vegetables and rice) because I couldn't find enough good papayas (most of the available ones in the mountain village I was living in tasted like gross beer in the ""off"" season), and mangosteen/dragon fruit are very expensive. The pain got so bad at one point I could only handle cucumbers which I dipped in honey/lemon/cayenne, then even honey hurt, yet my weight shot up 15lbs. It was probably water weight and inflammation from sun poisoning and digestive issues, but still. It dropped to 140ish when I returned to the northeast USA,  but I was also restricting my intake and eating very little (but all raw/vegan.)

"I still maintained a chubbier physique than I liked, no matter how ""clean"" I ate, even when juice fasting on watered down grapefruit juice, and managing to drop my weight the same it is now (138), my body composition was different. I wasn't fat or overweight, just not as lean as I felt I should have been with eating almost nothing but fruit/greens, and super low fat. My calories stayed around 1,500 most days (I'm 5'8"", was around 145lbs most of the time then, fairly active, so I was eating at a deficit, according to calculators.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My calorie intake is about the same now, usually between 1,300-1,600 mostly fat, moderate protein, under 30g net carbs (usually less), activity level is increased, but I've gone back up to 138 after having dropped to 135 a month ago (first month on keto this round.)

"Would love the scale to drop again, hoping for 120-125ish, but I think my bmr is probably lower than calculated due to a long bout with anorexia and on/off restricting after ""recovery"" throughout all my teens and early 20's, so I have to eat a higher deficit.

MotherOfCrickets,"She should've left ""starvation mode"" out of it but I think what she's trying to say is correct: you're better off eating healthy food (and done right you can eat seemingly a LARGE amount of healthy food) than you are trying to drastically restrict calories.

"Starvation mode applies to actual slowing of metabolism, which only occurs in extreme circumstances. What she seems to be talking about is twofold: When you attempt a drastic restriction you are likely to fail. Not only is it not good for you long run (see: actual cases of anorexia) but people are prone to rebounding ""oh I was SO good for two days, barely ate a thing! I can totally eat this entire cake!"" And second when you aren't properly fueling your body you are less inclined to move as much. Over time the subtle reduction in daily activity will add up.  Add in fatty delusion and victim complex and they think they've ""starved"" because they felt hungry for a day or two and then when the weight doesn't come off they convince themselves it can't possibly be their fault... Boom. ""Starvation mode"". A trainer should know better but really the test to be a trainer is so dumbed down.

It took years for them to be normal, to not care as much about their weight and food, to not panic when they ate over 500 calories and then go on the elliptical until they passed out to ""make up for it."" Anorexia isn't something you try out for a few months. It's a devastating mental illness. Hell, I had an extended period if at least 6 months where I barely ate and lost enough weight to scare my friends and I still say I wasn't anorexic, just screwed up, because I was able to go back to normal habits once I cut out my abusive ex.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"It was in that class that Nicole stabbed a pencil into her arm and then proceeded to snap said pencil in half over receiving an 84 on an exam. Nicole was prone to self-injury when upset; a therapist once told her that she might be on the autistic spectrum, but the counselor on campus disagreed; apparently, her social skills were ""not clinically impaired."" Nicole, like many young people whose psychological professionals don't reach a consensus on, has taken to Dr. Google to figure out why she had such poor emotional control and why she couldn't tolerate loud noises or chaotic environments and why she had a tendency to pace and fidget and otherwise be ""annoyingly hyperactive""; she had looked over many terms, like Asperger's, Non-verbal Learning Disorder, ADHD, hyperlexia, but none of them truly seemed to jive. Within any searches for childhoods disorders, of course, brought the clause, ""Many of these symptoms are also present in lycanthropic children without behavioral or learning disabilities."" She hadn't originally considered lycanthropy for herself, due to the obvious fact that neither she or anyone else in her entire family could shift into a wolf form, but she did recall being asked a few times throughout both her childhood and her college career if she were a werewolf, and it was only about a month ago that her American Folklore professor slipped her a flyer with the information for this very support group with an attached sticky note that said, ""This could help."" Although she lacked the whole ""turning into a wolf thing"" and, apparently, the ""werewolf look,"" there was something about lycanthropy that seemed to jive better than, say, autism or ADHD. She, like werewolves, was hypersensitive to auditory and tactile stimuli but hyposensitive to heat; she, like werewolves, was prone to fidgeting and the occasional non-cutting self-injury; she, like werewolves, preferred the company of animals and nature to humans; she, like werewolves, felt a sense of being ""not like the others,"" and years of being called a ""werido"" and a ""freak"" seemed to agree with this assessment. She even had a slight aversion to silver jewelry...although her skin didn't like nickle, either, and it was probably the nickle and not the silver that she was reacting to.

"Nicole had once considered the possibility that she was actually a werewolf that had some rare genetic mutation that made her unable to shift; she had spent her birthday money last year on an at-home DNA testing kit that, while too cheap and inefficient to detect *every* gene that a person may have, could most certainly pick up on the 24th chromosome that existed only in werewolves or the possible translocation of the genetic material on this chromosome to other chromosomes. Her results, however, had shown that she had exactly no genes that would cause her to be lycanthropic.

"She knew that it'd be foolish to show up at a Werewolf College Student Support Group, being that, well, she wasn't a werewolf, she really did, but...she had hoped that there'd be 4'11'', scrawny, kiddish-looking werewolves and that she wouldn't look so out of place...she had hoped that she could talk about how the self-injury just *happened* and how she didn't premeditate to ""get attention,"" how the world was just too much, too loud, how her body wouldn't let her be as still for as long as she was supposed to be, and be understood for just *once* in her lifetime. She had hoped that she could make friends that would empathize with her instead of pick on her.

"Nicole shook her head ""no."" Some humans (and perhaps some werewolves, too) still believed that lycanthropy could be transferred through bites or saliva (or even breath, according to some of the elder, more superstitious humans), but it had long been proven that lycanthropy was solely genetic in nature--it was rabies, not the ability to turn into a wolf, that was spread in all the legends of humans being ""turned."" The ability to transfer the material on the 24th chromosome was one that even the most advanced geneticists were still struggling with (besides, it was thought that lycanthropy also had some of its genetic roots in the 8th and 10th chromosome, though which genes in particular, scientists didn't yet understand).

So these are the people who used to be ""fat people who worked harder on their health than thin people"" according to the image, but now they're slim and fit.

Weight loss and proper diet can even reverse Type 2 Diabeetus or pre-Diabeetus. It can render PCOS asymptomatic.

uliarliarpantsonfire,"I would say first off to make sure that they understand how you've lost weight. I think sometimes weight loss in a person is scary if you don't understand how they are losing it. There is a lot of awareness about anorexia and bulimia now, which is great, but I think people are more watchful and get worried if they don't know how you lost the weight. My sister was concerned that there was such a difference in just my pictures (we live across the country) and had a minor freak out. I sent her the link to MFP and talked about what I eat and how it is working. She was relieved but still thinks I eat too much cauliflower. :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"If they are aware how you've done it and that you are eating healthy amounts then ask them what specifically their concerns are and why they feel you've changed. It may be that your activities were food centered before and now you are turning down those invites to limit exposure to temptation. It might even be unrelated to any of that, maybe you are stressed about work or something else and they see the weight loss and attribute the stress to it.

If none of that is the case and they can't give you a reasonable reason for concern then I'd say it's their problem. I just feel like we are kind of quick as women to write actual concern off as jealousy or being catty.

"22/F/5'9"" I'm a newish ketoer. Paleo fanatic for almost 5 years. I was doing ketosis while living on Hawaii for a few months in 2012 after I took on Dave Asprey's take on ""Bulletproof"". After some misinformation and his whole controversy, I went back to regular Paleo (sans BPC) but also gained back all of my weight. I don't know how to post the bar of my stats next to my name, as I see the comments below, but my starting weight: 170, current weight: 168, goal weight: 150. I've been struggling with inconsistency in diets for the last 4-5 years, yo-yoing constantly and having  an endless addiction to sugar, which in turn has been effective in continuing the eating disorder that I struggle with; bulimia (and I suffered from anorexia when I was 16, recovering in almost twice the amount of weight).

"After countless trial and error, ketosis seems like the only thing I can manage to the best of my abilities and proves the best results, not only aesthetically, but mentally I feel an immediate decrease in brain fog and hardly sluggish (except in the keto flu stage).

"Right now I'm on day 15, I lost 4 pounds in the first week, back tracked and gained back 2 pounds (after some mistakes were made when eating out), so now I gotta start the ketosis all over again. I'm like the many new ketoers in that I'm paranoid in going over my carbs, but if I happen to go over 30 I begin to rationalize that between 40-50g is good, even though I know that full ketosis is not in effect unless it's under 30. As of right now I've had some dizzy spells with having plenty of water since about 3 days ago, some fatigue, and definitely an unusual amount of rank breath...so could that mean I'm still in ketosis ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm getting frustrated already because I can't seem to stay below 30 and it seems so dogmatic in that if you cheat it seems like the end of the world!

Among the 98 patients who were taking less than 60 mg of methylphenidate a day, nine (9 percent) had anorexia, 16 (16 percent) had insomnia, and none developed tolerance. As Winsberg and associates found previously (4), tolerance developed only among children in our sample who were receiving more than 60 mg of methylphenidate or 40 mg of dextroamphetamine a day.

mcnuggetskitty,"I would say that you certainly have some disordered eating habits/attitudes, but I'm not qualified to say if it's an actual eating disorder. Diagnostically, for eating disorders, there's 4 categories: Anorexia (you don't meet the DSM criteria for that, but neither did I when I was hospitalized for an eating disorder, for the sole reason that I still got my period, so not being diagnostically anorexic doesn't always mean a whole lot; bulimia, which you don't meet the criteria for (again, neither did I, because I didn't binge enough even though I vomited 10-20 times a day); binge eating disorder, and eating disorder not otherwise specified (when there's definitely a clinical eating disorder but you don't meet all of the criteria for the other three).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I wasn't that concerned until you mentioned that you like being in control of your hunger. This sets off all kinds of warning bells for me, but not for the reasons most people have. Eating disorders can be ""about"" many things, sometimes control is one of them, sometimes it isn't. But the way you phrased it tells me there is a problem. ""Giving in"" to your body's signals of hunger isn't a weakness. It's funny how people think ""I have a body"" rather than ""I *am* a body"". Your body is telling you that you aren't caring for yourself properly. Listen to it. Feeling pride about overriding your body's instinctual needs for things like sustenance is a major red flag. An anorectic's daily calorie intake often seems normal to them. The body sometimes shuts down hunger signals when it thinks it's starving. There's a ton of other awful things that happen within your body when it believes there's a famine and it must make do with what little it is given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As someone who has had a severe eating disorder, I also find it to be one of the most honest portrayals of them that I have ever seen. Don't let yourself get any deeper into these patterns and attitudes. See a therapist that specializes in eating issues and see a nutritionist to find out what your body needs to keep you alive and thriving. Don't let yourself get to the point of no return.

snallygaster,"Pure fat acceptance isn't the answer, but outright shame/bullying isn't either. If it were only a matter of fat being unhealthy, shame might be the answer, just as it has curtailed smoking addiction and drunk driving, but fat is also considered ugly, so calling somebody a 'fat fuck', 'piggy', etc. is essentially calling them ugly as well. Which, of course, can lead to insecurity and mental health issues, since being called ugly is a very crippling insult to many people.  This can cause problems in the form of anorexia, bulimia, or even more binge eating, since food is a great comfort/diversion. Of course, fat acceptance is also pretty awful given that the movement enables unhealthy eating habits and gives fodder for people to rationalize away their fatness. I think that encouragement and reward for healthy habits and (healthy) weight loss are the best way to tackle the problem, along with widespread education about how to eat healthily and the consequences of obesity (and the positive consequences of fitness!).

The film attempts to stare down social issues such as video game culture, anorexia, infidelity, fame hunting, and the proliferation of illicit material on the internet. As each character and each relationship is tested, we are shown the variety of roads people choose - some tragic, some hopeful - as it becomes clear that no one is immune to this enormous social change that has come through our phones, our tablets, and our computers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My step mother was the primary abuser (mental emotional stuff). she had OCD and anorexia and was narcissistic....but I'm actually not that upset with her. she's just who she is. the person who I was always angriest with was my dad. he let it all happen. he put her first in everything. when she was going crazy and ranting and screaming at me when I was 5, he was the one who let it happen and then put tons of energy into making sure that SHE was feeling OK. He always told me how she wasn't responsible for what she did because ""she just doesn't like children"". and that bit him in the ass, because I ended up blaming him entirely. I would NEVER subject a child to someone acting that way, let along excuse them, let alone tell the child that it's their fault (which he did, apparently it would have been better if I had been a neat and clean 4 year old). I love my partner with all my heart, and we have a daughter together, but if he started abusing her like my step mother did to me I would leave him so fast his head would spin. because she is the most important thing in my life and he is the adult.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I learned about dieting from my mother, was encouraged by my ignorant, detached father, and my only roadblock was my mother's passive frustration. She needs kindness and warmth, not apathy, nor anger. I think talking to a therapist now is a good idea-- just be aware of what they're doing. When I first when to counseling they had me keep a food journal, and that was a huge trigger! Her therapy should focus on the potential eating disorder-- but also whatever else SHE feels is important to talk about.

My dad runs his own business and my mum was indifferent to everything except perhaps watching TV. My mum did the family shopping and no matter how much I asked she always brought in junk food. I would go to my room to cry because my dad would get frustrated if he knew I was upset, and when I came to him and told him that he wasn't supporting me he became infuriated because he thought it was an insult to his person.

But I think you should at least be willing to consider it. It can help your behavioral therapy to be more successful. Hopefully you can try therapy without it, but at least keep it as an option if you are struggling. Every medication has different side effects and if you have a good doctor, you can work with them to try out different types of drugs and at the minimum dose that is effective for you. You might find one that doesn't cause the bad side effects for you.

After at least thirty texts, calls, emails, etc. to her family, I finally found out where she had gone.  I wanted to let her know that I was there for her, and to have something warm and familiar in her dorm room, so I sewed her name onto a pillow, and then sewed her favorite quote on the back; ""Life is hard, but so very beautiful""--Abraham Lincoln.  I also sewed in a butterfly, since that was the extent of my sewing abilities.  With the pillow I sent her a book I had just read and enclosed a letter.

"I guess the point is, the emphasis of a physical quality being desirable is subjective. Just like how people with curly hair may be jealous of people with straight hair, while people with straight hair are jealous of people with curly hair. People with freckles might find fair skin desirable, while people with fair skin would die for some cute freckles. With body weight, you never know where a person's insecurities lie. You never know what parts of their metabolism they're struggling with, and you never know where they came from to get to where they are. Skinny shaming ignores all of this and just focuses on a person's appearance/attractiveness rather than their health.

Slinky_Girl,I stumbled upon a Pro-Ana blog a few years back.  She blogged about her struggle with anorexia on a regular basis.  After a few months of lurking she went from bad to worse.  She mentioned suicide and made real plans to hurt herself.  I was able to dig up enough basic information about her in her blog content (she played an unusual instrument and won a few contests) and contacted her Orchestra director in Melbourne.  Sent them proof and a small note about my concerns for her safety.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At first it totally helped the ""munchies"" get pretty real, but during the end of that reign, even smoking out of the big bong wouldn't boost my appetite so I gave it up.

I think we have been subject to social control systems for sex (a.k.a. religions) for so long that we have confused them with being absolute truth. Sure, sex can have unwanted consequences (babies, STIs, dodgy hookups, violence...) but so can food (obesity, poor nutrition, major health problems, anorexia, comfort eating...) - it's all part of being a mature human to figure out how to control these needs so that we avoid the consequences. Marital demands of exclusivity are the equivalent of saying you'll get really upset if a friend eats chocolate cake (or carrots) and not be their friend anymore (and take half their stuff) - they're only allowed to eat cauliflower and cabbage because that's what you want them to do.

* Great for self-study. When it comes to the acquisition of bare language skills (as opposed to literary theories etc.) professors are usually not much of a help and definitely not required. To get better at reading at Latin I just read Latin. I'm not going to run out of texts to read for the rest of my life. To get better at composing Latin I read Latin and then try to reproduce/imitate what I have read. To get better at speaking Latin I just talk to myself. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"* Language learning doesn't require great intelligence, just a lot of practice. The biggest idiot of 50 BC had an infinitely better grasp of Latin than I do. This is very encouraging imo, basically a guarantee of success. Put in the hours and sooner or later you'll get the results.

"* I get very direct feedback by keeping track of the number of pages/lines of verse I read per hour. Half a year ago I read Cicero at 6-8 pages/hour, now I consistently read 10+ pages/hour.

LePew_was_a_creep,"I think, as a society, we joke a lot about eating disorders without ever seeing the nastiness and pain that is associated with them. So it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking having an ED is something to almost admirable. On some level anorexia is often used interchangeably with extreme dieting (not just here, but as a broader societal misconception). I had a very dear friend of mine suffer from it and I genuinely worried she might die, as somewhere between 5 and 20 percent of people with anorexia do. She hated herself and it dominated every aspect of her life. When I think of an eating disorder, I think of seeing her ribs through her skin and worrying that her body might be digesting her heart - which is what happens when your body is starving.

Talk to her about seeing a psychiatrist for evaluation and let her sit in with you if you like; don't tell the psychiatrist about how insistent she's being with her in the room though as it would just end in more negativity for you. Also if you do opt to see a psychiatrist it would be a good idea to get them to explain what anorexia nervosa is because it seems like she may not fully understand.

And social media doesn't help, the girls in my school have pictures of them in bikinis with their flat/toned stomachs and I haven't ever worn a two-piece in public. It's so disappointing. I got into sports after being bullied for being fat, and even after that I havent been able to lose weight. I guess it's because I don't see food as fuel but as an enjoyable part of the day, I don't know.

grumpyfat," There has been historical documentation of cases of anorexia and bulimia dating back hundreds (even thousands, I believe, but need to find my source before I say for sure) of years, long before there was any overwhelming cultural emphasis on beauty and thinness. It is estimated that only 2-5% of the U.S. population suffers from restrictive type eating disorders, and that it is a generous figure. I don't know this for sure, but I would imagine that those numbers don't differ too dramatically in populations of societies that don't subscribe to western ideals of beauty. I think that certainly our obsession with appearance contributes to, and can even be the main instigator of disordered eating habits, but not actual eating disorders.

"BED is eating abnormally large amounts of food in a shorter than normal time period, which could be one sitting or over the course of days depending on the person and binge episode. It's common to eat so much food you become physically so full you are in pain but to continue eating.

"I am not a doctor, but I imagine being malnourished effects your bodies ability to do anything efficiently.  Your metabolism increases on T meaning you'll feel hungrier, have more energy, but also put on more weight if you don't work out.  If you are malnourished you're not going to be able to build muscle effectively.  I think it's possible to work on both problems at the same time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Not really.  You cannot pick and choose which changes will happen on T- all the changes will come eventually, but being a low dose just means they will come slowly.  If you are on a low dose you won't experience as much muscle gain or fat redistribution, so you probably won't have a very male body shape.  If you like your female body you should think long and hard about if T is really right for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My best advice would honestly be one day at a time. Nothing will change your body as quickly as you want it to. It'll take weeks of dedication to even see results and months to get the ones you want. Patience. Don't slip. Stay strong and keep moving upwards.

Yes models are thin and some are very thin.

They should have sat her down and spoken to her about this and trying to figure out what caused it and how to help.

If your mother cannot understand your sister's disability, I would try and educate her on it as much as possible with all the articles and magazines you can find on this topic.

"I've suffered from depression, anorexia and anxiety so I feel like I might be qualified enough to help you out. When you're stressed, like you are at school, your body is in the fight or flight mode. It thinks at any moment it's going to need to fight for your life so of course food doesn't rate high in its priorities. That's why you're not eating and have no appetite at school. All of this anxiety wears you down so quickly and with you not getting much sleep you're having no time to recover. The winters especially so difficult because the days are short and dark, the weathers fighting you and all you want to do is rest!

"The most loving thing that you can do in this relationship at this point is to act in her long-term interest before you cut contact post-breakup. It only requires one person to initiate a breakup.

"Seeing as DCF has been involved before on legitimate grounds, I would recommend bringing them in again. It does have some risk, since the people who staff DCF are only human and are making judgment calls to the best of their ability (not always perfect). But if she is willing to bring up her ED, they may help her get the treatment she needs. I had a friend who was taken away from her biological parents and made a ward of the state as a teen while she was hospitalized for anorexia for months. A decade later she has been at a healthy weight for years and became a yoga teacher with her own charity designed to bring yoga to the neediest populations. Being ""taken away"" was painful but ended up becoming one of the best things that ever happened to her.

The film attempts to stare down social issues such as video game culture, anorexia, infidelity, fame hunting, and the proliferation of illicit material on the internet. As each character and each relationship is tested, we are shown the variety of roads people choose - some tragic, some hopeful - as it becomes clear that no one is immune to this enormous social change that has come through our phones, our tablets, and our computers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I imagine that you can't simply hop on Craigslist or some other hookup site and start hooking up.  I mean, you certainly could, but if you do it you're going to react negatively most likely.  That's because you're trained to do with it... which amounts to being trained to oppose it since sex is a natural urge every human being has.  Being able to follow those urges will take time, probably a lot of time and experience.  Re-training yourself after decades of experience is difficult.  Abstinence is like anorexia.  Eating is healthy, having sex is healthy.  Not eating causes health problems, not having sex causes health problems (mostly longer-term ones than eating, but health problems all the same).  Often it's an issue of control.  Natural urges arise and you resist them, then you start to identify yourself with your ability to resist them, the disciplines you invent to stay away from them, etc.  Losing control makes you feel either like a bad person or, at least, 'less you'.  Changing things like that are probably the hardest things a human being can do, especially later in life.  You'll also likely get to experience what it's like for your rational mind and your emotional state to come unglued.  You'll KNOW something is good for you, but you will feel like poison.  That's because emotional reactions are trained reactions, they're not based on anything sensible at all.

bluedinosaur221,"I understand what you're saying, but it doesn't seem like her parents were (any longer) blocking her access to support online. She clearly had pretty unfettered online access given her Tumblr. And for whatever reason, whether she saw these posts and reblogs or not, she didn't reach out directly. But she was clearly asking for someone to help her. I don't use Tumblr or Instagram and I've only recently become aware that there is an intricate network of suicide, self-harm, anorexia, etc. blogs and that they are in contact with one another, they like each other's posts, they're reblogging, and they use certain hashtags. So I guess I'm saying maybe these outreach organizations and helplines need to become more aware of that and try to engage before the person on the other end reaches out themselves.

"After reading your post... Maybe you're non-binary! If you really think you'd be more comfortable if you moved physically toward one end of the spectrum, the main routes I'd suggest are testosterone or birth control pills (some people get huge boobs on birth control pills and soft skin and stuff--you can ask your doctor about the side effects and see if you'd like to try one). If you wanted to try testosterone, your primary care provider might be willing to prescribe it to you but they might not. For that, I'd had to an informed consent clinic for trans people, say you're figuring yourself out and would like a more masculine body, and see if they're willing to prescribe to you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It took me a few years to sort through everything, and nothing fell into place until I met a trans woman and realized gender transition was possible.

Specifically, they are the kind of people to comment on people's bodies, not to their faces, of course, but they're always quick to comment if someone has gained weight or ""needs to lose weight"".  I now realize that their perceptions of what ""skinny"" and ""healthy"" are are unrealistic and skewed.  For example, my dad once made a comment about how Sandra Bullock (of all people) ""could stand to lose maybe ten or fifteen pounds.""  My parents have also, throughout my life, emphasized to me that I'm not skinny, but I'm average/normal.  And okay, fair enough, I am average/""normal"" in weight.  But paired with their obvious preference for skinniness, negative remarks if I appeared to gain weight, and reminiscing about how they used to be so skinny and could eat baked potatoes loaded with butter every night for a midnight snack and never gain any weight when they were young, it's enough to mess with a kid's head.  And then I got anorexia.  I was actually able to stop myself before things got too out of hand, but they still don't know it ever happened.  At the time, they praised me for my weight loss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I absolutely do not blame my parents for what happened.  Overall, they were very good parents and I have a good relationship with both of them.  What I'm saying is that even non-abusive words and behavior patterns by parents can have a negative impact on vulnerable or at-risk children.  Meanwhile, your husband IS abusive and your daughter pretty clearly is being affected by it.  And divorcing and getting her away from him if he doesn't stop is essential.  It might hurt in the short run, but in the long run it might make the difference between having a daughter with lifelong body image issues and a dead daughter.  And while not ideal either way, the former is vastly preferable to the latter.  If the abuse gets interrupted quickly enough, your daughter might even have a chance at being 100% cured.  Please keep divorce a real option.  This is a life and death matter.  I really hope that your husband will stop very quickly so it won't be necessary, but your daughter needs help ASAP and she needs you to be her advocate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sarahthesnowgirl,"When I was 13, I was weighed at the doctors office in front of my dad.  I was wearing doc Martins at the time and they  probably added 6ish lbs.  I was actually underweight,  but he made a comment about how I was ""porking up"".  And for the next ten years,  I dealt with both anorexia and bulimia. He refused to believe for years that my eating disorder and depression were in any way related to him.  Then,  after a suicide attempt at 21,  being 5'4 and weighing in at a whopping 89 lbs, I got him (with a lot of help from my mom) to come to therapy with me,  where my therapist refused to let him sit there blameless.  It finally hit home for him,  that  some of my issues stemmed from how he treated me.  I wish I could say that he did a complete 180 (he didn't), but at least I gave it my all and he has to live with knowing how his careless words over the years,  shaped my life.  I can happily say that I am at a very healthy weight now and happily gained 40lbs during my pregnancy.  I got lucky and got to talk to an amazing therapist and had tons of support from my mom and friends and family.  Remind her everyday that she is beautiful.  Make her tell herself 3 positive things about herself everyday (they have to be different everyday). Put positive notes about her on her mirror,  where she'll see them,  when she sees herself.  And be ready to support her and be prepared for backsides.  If/when they happen, remind her of why she needs to eat and keep it down and that she is stronger than any eating disorder.

The film attempts to stare down social issues such as video game culture, anorexia, infidelity, fame hunting, and the proliferation of illicit material on the internet. As each character and each relationship is tested, we are shown the variety of roads people choose - some tragic, some hopeful - as it becomes clear that no one is immune to this enormous social change that has come through our phones, our tablets, and our computers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Caldwing,Well they make a lot fantastic claims with no proof.  They constantly reinforce each other's deep-seated sexual shame.

Rackenisawesome,"I can't technically classify you as anything - I'm not a doctor and I don't have enough information of your diet/life style - but I will say restrictive EDs refer to purposely eating an extremely low amount of calories (and possibly other things, but the main one is calories) to lose weight over a long period of time. Basically, it's anorexia, but with people who don't meet the weight/body fat % or the psychological requirements to be diagnosed with it. I guess it's possible to have an ED where you stay away from other foods like catbs, but like all EDs there's a certain psychological element, usually a great fear of messing up the diet or losing weight, more than a ""rational"" person would have. There's a difference between restrictive EDs and restrictive diets. Things like keto and paleo diets restrict things your body doesn't really need, so they're not really ED level. A calorie restriction diet would be something like cutting from 2000 to 1600 to lose weight, or even down to 1200. Restrict EDs are cutting your calories down to under 1000, an unhealthy amount.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cardamomlace2,"If she's in and out for treatment for anorexia all the time, I would be really worried about it rubbing off on your kid. Your daughter is a preteen now, but she's pretty much on the cusp of getting to that age where girls start becoming very self conscious of their bodies and your wife is in a very bad place to be an actual parent for her. Even if she is careful to not enforce negative attitudes (I.e, she is carefully to not use body shaming language, etc), her own habits, like not eating or obsessive calorie counting, are gonna rub off on your daughter and signal to her that having unhealthily obsessive habits like your wife might be normal or desirable. That isn't to say that women who have been anorexic in the past are unfit parents, but your wife is in and out of the hospital all the time, and she seems like she can barely deal with herself, much less a kid. I feel like your wife absolutely needs to be in counseling or working on getting her anorexia in control before you can even begin to consider her to be a fully there parent, especially with the drug abuse.

Telling someone with an eating disorder to ""just eat"" is the same as telling someone with depression to ""just smile"". It's not that simple.

I didn't care about what anyone thought I looked like. I cared about being up to my standard of thinness, which was informed by my depression and dissatisfaction in other parts of my life.

Alect0,I am almost 30 but at your age I was pretty much like you are. As a kid I would literally sit at the dinner table for hours eating my dinner as I'd cut the things that I didn't like up into tiny tablet sized pieces and swallow each bit with a sip of water. I wasn't allowed to leave the table until I was done and I kept this up for years. I also had anorexia for most of my teenage years and spent a lot of times just not eating anything. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"To me what has helped me get over being so fussy and foods making me sick to eat has been learning to cook more and more meals over the last decade. When I can cook my own meals and control what goes into them it became easier to cope with adding new foods so now I eat a wide range of food from all sorts of cuisines. Any kind of pressure on me to try something new from others did not help me at ALL. I would eat it as a kid as I knew I had to but would get sick and still not end up liking it. If I got a surprise taste or texture sometimes I would throw up or gag, just couldn't help it. But if I knew it was coming I could prepare for it.

"For example the texture of mushrooms made me sick, even just thinking about it. If I found out something had mushrooms in it I would feel grossed out after I had eaten it. One day I decided to learn to cook beef stroganoff and the first time I make a recipe I hate deviating from the instructions so I knew I had to figure out a way to incorporate 200g of mushrooms. I cut them up into tiny tiny pieces and they dissolved into the sauce and because the texture was gone leaving just the flavour I could handle them. Now I can even handle bigger pieces of mushrooms but I still don't like the texture. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other therapists who utilize ERP may tell you to observe your thoughts and report back so that they can target triggers more effectively (which is why being as honest as possible about obsessions and such are beneficial to ERP).

"Finally, as to Luvox, it doesn't seem to actually cause weight gain (quite the opposite, in fact, as it has a warning for ""unintentional"" anorexia). Since I am not your GP or psychiatrist, I don't want to give you too much advice relating to this, but what my psychiatrist told me when putting me on some stuff was that the prescription was an option she was giving me. That's all GPs, psychiatrists, and therapists are; *options*. Only you really know you the best, so it's ultimately up to you to decide what you think is right for you. Medication has worked out well for me, but it's definitely not something I plan on staying on forever, and getting a prescription filled is not a guarantee you'll be medicated forever.

"Finally (part 2), for me, OCD does not really go away no matter how busy I am. Things can just randomly cause an attack, and cause me to more or less shut down, which sucks. That's why I'm currently taking medication, because I don't want to have to deal with that right now. I am also in ERP, so I will hopefully get off medication once I can control it better without the meds. Additionally most SSRIs have a ""ramp up"" period of about 3 weeks for the medication to start to take effect. After that, I haven't experienced many side effects. Again, though, only you know you the best. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Individual therapy I found was definitely my favorite and most beneficial. My main thing I struggled with was that my weight wasn't low enough and I wasn't considered anorexic but that I had ED-NOS (which I know most ED patients can associate with, we aren't taken ""serious"" until we are almost just skin and bones). But I poured my heart out to my therapist who was great, and she made it clear to me that I had anorexia and it didn't matter what medical books said, and for me it was like a mark in time. Once I had ""achieved"" this, I could move on. It sounds strange, but it sort of made a difference. That and the tattoo I got along with it.

"I also did group therapy, which was so-so. It was great to be around others that knew what you were going through, but physically being in a room with them was hard because you were constantly comparing yourself to their bodies which was just really difficult. What I REALLY recommend, is the book ""Life Without Ed, by Jenni Shafer"". You've probably heard of it, you might even have it. But when I read it I felt like it was written about myself.

valentinaolsen,"I might be so far down in the comments you may not see this, but I think you are doing the right thing. At around 10 yes old my dad started saying I ate too much and I was built like a man (if you look in my submitted picture history [NSFW!!!] you will see I'm actually very much built like a woman and very tiny). By age 11, I began cutting myself whenever he called me a man, and by age 13, I was full-blown anorexic. And if I was forced to eat anything, I would throw it up. This lasted until I was 22 and 5'6 and 89 lbs. and I was so skinny. My dad never realized he was the problem. A few of my friends knew and finally my boyfriend at the time said you are getting help whether I have to baker act you or not (for cutting, I don't think he could baker act me for the anorexia). So I started trying to eat again to get to 110 lbs. and started seeing a therapist about my cutting and it was hard and I cried when I looked at myself as I was gaining the weight back, because I saw myself as a huge obese man, even though of course I didn't look like that at all. I am now 24 and still struggle with the urge to cut and not to start skipping meals when I feel I look a bit hefty (5'6 and 117 lbs now, still underweight but decent). What your husband said can have long term effects on her even if you try your best to tell her she's beautiful. Not saying she may be cutting (that's a rare thing to do and I'm not even sure what prompted me to start) but she will always live with what he said. Your positive words don't always make up for his mean ones. All I can say is keep her in therapy as long as she feels she needs it and don't let her get to the point I did. I could have died at my lowest weight and that didn't matter to me, all that mattered was that I didn't look like I built like a man. Everyone always told me what a dainty little girl I was, just my dads words always were in the back of my head. Those words never go away and it will be a tough struggle to get out of if she has gotten to far into an anorexia mindset. Let her know they have given me permanent heart and thyroid problems because of my foolishness, as they do many others who are anorexic. She seems like a smart girl, I pray for the best for her health and your family to recover from this. I feel like if my mom had stopped my dad from calling me a man all the time none of my problems would've ever started so you are doing the right thing nipping it in the bud.

"I spent 10 years or so NOT dealing with my mental health, and they were miserable years- I was never suicidal, but I frequently knowingly put myself in situations that could have easily led to death, at the very least more rape. Something happens to you when you undergo this kind of trauma. Because of it, you are in danger of generating more trauma for yourself in the form of unhealthy sexual relationships and possible substance abuse, among other things. For example, I developed anorexia that lasted for a couple years after both of the above traumas. Additionally, I highly doubt I would have dated an abusive partner had I not previously been the victim of a sex crime- sexual abuse can lead to further sexual abuse, which further confirms your suspicions that all men really just want to rape you- they don't! But you can't just know that intellectually- your body has to know it. Mine had to unlearn reactions to being touched. A perfectly safe man, a man I'd consented to sexual activity with, would touch me, and I'd just submit to him, and then my mind would disappear from my body. You can't just will this kind of thing away- it's a conditioned reaction. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You have to create a new world for yourself that is defined by what you want from your life, and each day take steps towards it.

No one blames you for it, except for that crazy lady at your dad's hearing- she is likely someone who also underwent sexual trauma at some point too who is very, very unstable and in some kind of very messed up relationship with your father.

I was anorexic for about a year and it worked like a charm (not advocating anorexia). Building muscle is proving to be much harder. There's no real reason to think that getting a hobby would allow me to get into relationships with the opposite sex. Maybe it could improve my odds slightly, but I don't even know if that's the case. With these women it was incredibly obvious to me that there was one thing that they needed to do and they would be able to expand their dating options exponentially, and there is a clear tried and true path towards reaching that goal. I couldn't understand why they just didn't do that. They wouldn't have to devote any time to it really, just cut down on calorie intake. Even exercising is optional.

hockey_puck,"Basically. Think of it this way: if you had a community of people who thought being transgendered was just fine, got transgendered people everything they needed to realize their transitions, and otherwise supported them 100% in their goal, no one would be harmed. If you had a community of people who were 100% devoted to helping anorexics achieve their goals of being as thin as they want to be, a lot of people would end up dead. Anorexia without treatment has grievous, often permanent or fatal effects on the body due to lack of nutrients.

I'm going to have to agree with you. Someone close to me suffered from anorexia and went into modeling. She was rejected because she was too short and her anorexia worsened.

TerribleAttitude,"I hate this.  And I hate hearing ""anorexic"" and ""bulimic.""  I've gained weight through the magic of a slowly aging metabolism, so I no longer get those comments, but even when I see other people called them, it hurts my feelings.  Because it hurts to have my body scrutinized and judged, but even further, because I know people who *do* struggle with eating disorders, and I've studied psychology.  It hurts to know my friends who have serious mental illnesses aren't being taken seriously, because their conditions are a joke to make fun of thin people.  It hurts to know that the heavier and average-sized people I know who struggle with these issues may never truly get help because they don't ""look"" bulimic.  It hurts that the people I know who are thin who have these issues may be believed, but will still be brushed aside.  It hurts that so many people with these problems have them stem from genetics, from poor self-esteem, from brain chemistry, from unhealthy home lives and relationships, but won't have those sources examined and treated seriously because everyone is caught up with these being quirks of ""stuck up skinny girls"" who read too many magazines, instead of the devastating and potentially life threatening illness it is.  People already don't take mental illnesses seriously, but anorexia and bulimia are a societal joke.  I've heard people make fun of their so-called friends for struggling with it.  I've watched friends be taunted and abused by their own parents for being honest and trying to get help for it.  I've read stories about underage models forced into starving themselves to keep jobs that pay almost nothing becoming hospitalized or *dying*, and seen all the comments be jokes, or self-righteous comments about the ""thin privilege"" these girls apparently held.

"If someone calls me a skinny bitch or says ""only dogs like bones"" or something like that, it....hurts my feelings, but I get over it.  It's a mean world.  We all get called mean names sometimes.  But making fun of eating disorders to tease someone about their body or make a point about thin privilege isn't just being mean and calling names and bullying.  It's insulting the person you're name-calling, and it's inadvertently tearing down everyone who's had a serious mental illness, for the sake of a joke or a childish insult.

"As an aside, I was talking to a friend of mine recently who'd struggled with eating disorders in the past, and when people who didn't know *why* she was so skinny called her ""anorexic"" as a mean joke, she thought they were making a mean joke about her being *fat,* not about her being skinny.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Don't be anorexic, then. I don't know anyone in *real life* who encourages anorexia. Girls are ALWAYS going to feel insecure about their bodies because their bodies are changing and they're going to see that there's always someone else who has physical qualities that make them feel inferior. Because there's *always* someone ""better than you"" when you compare yourself to other people in that way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But back to my point, how does ""m-m-muh unrealistic standards of beauty"" in any way justify morbid obesity? It doesn't. You're still abusing your body. Forget about beauty, because this isn't about being attractive. This is about *health* and you can't STAY healthy being morbidly obese. You can temporarily BE healthy because you're still too young to have felt the ill effects of morbid obesity, but those health problems will be coming because they are a natural consequence of so much extra weight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I like to find healthy recipes and healthier options for the foods I like so I don't feel deprived. Eat less processed/junk food.

Transgender Surgery Isn't the Solution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A drastic physical change doesn't address underlying psycho-social troubles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dr. McHugh, former psychiatrist in chief at Johns Hopkins Hospital, is the author of ""Try to Remember: Psychiatry's Clash Over Meaning, Memory, and Mind"" (Dana Press, 2008).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The government and media alliance advancing the transgender cause has gone into overdrive in recent weeks. On May 30, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services review board ruled that Medicare can pay for the ""reassignment"" surgery sought by the transgenderedóthose who say that they don't identify with their biological sex. Earlier last month Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said that he was ""open"" to lifting a ban on transgender individuals serving in the military. Time magazine, seeing the trend, ran a cover story for its June 9 issue called ""The Transgender Tipping Point: America's next civil rights frontier.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet policy makers and the media are doing no favors either to the public or the transgendered by treating their confusions as a right in need of defending rather than as a mental disorder that deserves understanding, treatment and prevention. This intensely felt sense of being transgendered constitutes a mental disorder in two respects. The first is that the idea of sex misalignment is simply mistakenóit does not correspond with physical reality. The second is that it can lead to grim psychological outcomes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The transgendered suffer a disorder of ""assumption"" like those in other disorders familiar to psychiatrists. With the transgendered, the disordered assumption is that the individual differs from what seems given in natureónamely one's maleness or femaleness.

"With body dysmorphic disorder, an often socially crippling condition, the individual is consumed by the assumption ""I'm ugly."" These disorders occur in subjects who have come to believe that some of their psycho-social conflicts or problems will be resolved if they can change the way that they appear to others. Such ideas work like ruling passions in their subjects' minds and tend to be accompanied by a solipsistic argument.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"For the transgendered, this argument holds that one's feeling of ""gender"" is a conscious, subjective sense that, being in one's mind, cannot be questioned by others. The individual often seeks not just society's tolerance of this ""personal truth"" but affirmation of it. Here rests the support for ""transgender equality,"" the demands for government payment for medical and surgical treatments, and for access to all sex-based public roles and privileges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With this argument, advocates for the transgendered have persuaded several statesóincluding California, New Jersey and Massachusettsóto pass laws barring psychiatrists, even with parental permission, from striving to restore natural gender feelings to a transgender minor.

"How to respond? Psychiatrists obviously must challenge the solipsistic concept that what is in the mind cannot be questioned. Disorders of consciousness, after all, represent psychiatry's domain; declaring them off-limits would eliminate the field. Many will recall how, in the 1990s, an accusation of parental sex abuse of children was deemed unquestionable by the solipsists of the ""recovered memory"" craze.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"You won't hear it from those championing transgender equality, but controlled and follow-up studies reveal fundamental problems with this movement. When children who reported transgender feelings were tracked without medical or surgical treatment at both Vanderbilt University and London's Portman Clinic, 70%-80% of them spontaneously lost those feelings. Some 25% did have persisting feelings; what differentiates those individuals remains to be discerned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"We at Johns Hopkins Universityówhich in the 1960s was the first American medical center to venture into ""sex-reassignment surgery""ólaunched a study in the 1970s comparing the outcomes of transgendered people who had the surgery with the outcomes of those who did not. Most of the surgically treated patients described themselves as ""satisfied"" by the results, but their subsequent psycho-social adjustments were no better than those who didn't have the surgery. And so at Hopkins we stopped doing sex-reassignment surgery, since producing a ""satisfied"" but still troubled patient seemed an inadequate reason for surgically amputating normal organs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It now appears that our long-ago decision was a wise one. A 2011 study at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden produced the most illuminating results yet regarding the transgendered, evidence that should give advocates pause. The long-term studyóup to 30 yearsófollowed 324 people who had sex-reassignment surgery. The study revealed that beginning about 10 years after having the surgery, the transgendered began to experience increasing mental difficulties. Most shockingly, their suicide mortality rose almost 20-fold above the comparable nontransgender population. This disturbing result has as yet no explanation but probably reflects the growing sense of isolation reported by the aging transgendered after surgery. The high suicide rate certainly challenges the surgery prescription.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are subgroups of the transgendered, and for none does ""reassignment"" seem apt. One group includes male prisoners like Pvt. Bradley Manning, the convicted national-security leaker who now wishes to be called Chelsea. Facing long sentences and the rigors of a men's prison, they have an obvious motive for wanting to change their sex and hence their prison. Given that they committed their crimes as males, they should be punished as such; after serving their time, they will be free to reconsider their gender.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Another subgroup consists of young men and women susceptible to suggestion from ""everything is normal"" sex education, amplified by Internet chat groups. These are the transgender subjects most like anorexia nervosa patients: They become persuaded that seeking a drastic physical change will banish their psycho-social problems. ""Diversity"" counselors in their schools, rather like cult leaders, may encourage these young people to distance themselves from their families and offer advice on rebutting arguments against having transgender surgery. Treatments here must begin with removing the young person from the suggestive environment and offering a counter-message in family therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then there is the subgroup of very young, often prepubescent children who notice distinct sex roles in the culture and, exploring how they fit in, begin imitating the opposite sex. Misguided doctors at medical centers including Boston's Children's Hospital have begun trying to treat this behavior by administering puberty-delaying hormones to render later sex-change surgeries less onerousóeven though the drugs stunt the children's growth and risk causing sterility. Given that close to 80% of such children would abandon their confusion and grow naturally into adult life if untreated, these medical interventions come close to child abuse. A better way to help these children: with devoted parenting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the heart of the problem is confusion over the nature of the transgendered. ""Sex change"" is biologically impossible. People who undergo sex-reassignment surgery do not change from men to women or vice versa. Rather, they become feminized men or masculinized women. Claiming that this is civil-rights matter and encouraging surgical intervention is in reality to collaborate with and promote a mental disorder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You feel like you are walking on eggshells with a girl you care about and I can only imagine how difficult that it. If she happens to be seeing a therapist maybe you can throw out the idea of going to a session with her? Just make sure she understands that you want to go not because you want to tattle on her or attack her in anyway. Tell her you want to understand what she is going through as much as you can and that you think it would benefit your relationship to be apart of her treatment process.

Gingerdyke,Kind of depends on how you define it. A lot of medication for common ailments like depression can increase appetite and cause a normally healthy person to start overeating. Something like social anxiety or agoraphobia could impact exercise attempts. Something like recovering bullemia or anorexia can take away your ability to calorie count.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conversely, my sister, who's a good 25 lbs underweight and has been genuinely diagnosed with anorexia nervosa doesn't have a thigh gap. If you have wide, angled hips and are relatively slim, you'll probably have a thigh gap regardless of whether or not you have an ED, and likewise, some people weren't built to ever have one. Ironic that organizations that proclaim to be body-positive are willing to ban certain models for their build, especially on the basis of a physical phenomena that really isn't exclusive to people who are underweight, and I strongly doubt that they would ever object to a model without a thigh gap on the grounds that it might promote obesity.

"Any individual who has had negligible nutrient intake for more than 5 consecutive days is at risk of refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome usually occurs within four days of starting to feed. Patients can develop fluid and electrolyte disorders, especially hypophosphatemia, along with neurologic, pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, and hematologic complications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"During prolonged fasting the body aims to conserve muscle and protein breakdown by switching to ketone bodies derived from fatty acids as the main energy source. The liver decreases its rate of gluconeogenesis thus conserving muscle and protein. Many intracellular minerals become severely depleted during this period, although serum levels remain normal. Importantly, insulin secretion is suppressed in this fasted state and glucagon secretion is increased.[4]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"During refeeding, insulin secretion resumes in response to increased blood sugar; resulting in increased glycogen, fat and protein synthesis. This process requires phosphates, magnesium and potassium which are already depleted and the stores rapidly become used up. Formation of phosphorylated carbohydrate compounds in the liver and skeletal muscle depletes intracellular ATP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in red blood cells, leading to cellular dysfunction and inadequate oxygen delivery to the body's organs. Refeeding increases the basal metabolic rate. Intracellular movement of electrolytes occurs along with a fall in the serum electrolytes, including phosphate, potassium and magnesium. Glucose, and levels of the B vitamin thiamine may also fall. **Cardiac arrhythmias are the most common cause of death from refeeding syndrome, with other significant risks including confusion, coma and convulsions and cardiac failure.**",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**This syndrome can occur at the beginning of treatment for anorexia nervosa when patients have an increase in calorie intake and can be lethal.[5] The shifting of electrolytes and fluid balance increases cardiac workload and heart rate. This can lead to acute heart failure. Oxygen consumption is also increased which strains the respiratory system and can make weaning from ventilation more difficult.**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I think the most common misconception is that it is about being thin. I have honestly never met a person who developed an eating disorder because they wanted to look like some photoshopped model. For us, its about perfection and control, it just so happens that thinness is a trait that our society admires, which is why we strive to achieve it. At a certain point, you are intellectually aware that you are not attractive and dying, but this irrational little part of your brain won't let you eat because you're still too big.

Thankfully, the nurse told me the shrink was lying, and if I stood my ground, they couldn't send me anywhere. So, I spent Day 1 sleeping on a stretcher in a shared room until a bed freed up in the psych ward, which thankfully only took a day to happen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wasn't allowed to wear my own clothes until the psych staff deemed it ""safe,"" so I was stuck in a hospital gown and socks for two days (this probably wouldn't be as big of an issue for anyone else, but I signed myself in for anorexia, so it's not like I had a lot of body fat to spare, and it was in the middle of a blizzard).

"I had a roommate in the psych ward, and if I'm not mistaken, all of the rooms were two-person, with the exception of a single one-person room for people with physical disabilities who needed the accommodations. Each bedroom had an attached bathroom. Then, there was the ""dining room"" (I spent no time in here, because I refused to eat unless I was allowed to do so in my bedroom), a game room, an ""art therapy"" room, and a standard psychologist's office. None of the doors had locks, but we were allowed to close the doors at will, and people generally respected your privacy. I was *very* antisocial during my entire stay--I slept nearly the entire time--and all the patients respected that. At night, the staff does checks to make sure you haven't killed yourself while your roommate is sleeping, but they just shine a flashlight into the room to see if you're still breathing.

It's not because I was against it; I was just so fucking tired and I just needed a break.

"After day 4, I think, it became very clear to me that I didn't belong in the psych ward, because the staff didn't specialize in eating disorders, which is what I so desperately needed to be treated (I have depression, anxiety, dissociation, and all that shit, too, but the eating disorder was literally killing me day by day). And this is where I had an issue: After signing yourself in, you can't just waltz out of the psych ward; the doctors can hold you for 72 hours after you request to check yourself out, and if they deem you a threat to yourself or others, they can petition a court to keep you *in* the hospital. The staff agreed I wasn't a threat, but they were hesitant to let me out, I think because I was such an outspoken pain in the ass who swore a lot and questioned every decision they made (it's my nature). Thankfully, the head psychiatrist specialized in eating disorders and very clearly realized I needed different treatment, so I didn't have to wait the full 72 hours to get out. She referred me to a couple of treatment centers in the area, and started the paperwork for me. She saved me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"So when these people talk about how they had a restrictive eating disorder, I can believe that they restricted sometimes. But they deny the fact that they were reactively overeating later, resulting in weight maintenance or even gain. You cannot be anorexic and be fat, but they all want to claim that they had anorexia. The reason they do this is because if they couldn't be skinny when they had anorexia, then obviously weight loss is literally impossible, and it would be unreasonable for anyone to expect them to lose weight. Problem is, it's a lie. If they were heavily restricting and maintaining/gaining weight, they were heavily binge eating later to compensate. That's an eating disorder, but it's not anorexia.

dolostone7," There were all sort of contributing factors, the most important one is genetic.  I hope I didn't give the impression that one toy single handedly drove me to that dark place, I just didn't think anyone wanted to sit through the whole story of how things progressed so I skipped ahead.  As I already mentioned, an essential factor is genetics.  (Only a certain percentage of youngsters have the gene for anorexia sitting dormant, waiting to be triggered)  The Barbie experience was my first trigger that set of the body dismorphia.  From that point forward, I looked in the mirror and saw myself maybe twenty pounds heavier, with a special distaste for my thighs. Every time I looked at someone else I would compare their size to mine, especially if they were smaller.    It's weird to look bad at the pictures now and see how different I actually looked like to what I thought at the time.  My mother didn't help. Sometimes she'd comment that my sister and I were much bigger than she was as a kid, or tell me I shouldn't be eating that.  That was a terrible thing to say to kid who already wouldn't go into a pool without wearing shorts to cover her thighs, and I vow I will NEVER make those sort of mistakes if I ever have children of my own.   The dam broke when my best friend in high school would say things that would especially trigger that fear of food, which is when I first acted out against the ""obese"" person I saw in the mirror and fought the enemy (food).  So yes, the whole thing wasn't because of one doll, Barbie was just my first memory of a snowball process that went out of control.   I don't like to think about that part of my life anymore, because it is filled with regret.  But I do feel responsible for sharing my story in the hopes that people understand how serious triggers can be for an unfortunate percent of us.  But my story does have a happy ending: a little while after the salad incident I brought myself to a therapist's office in tears, and got the help I needed. I now have a good control of my triggers, am incredibly body positive, and spend every day so happy that I'm still around to enjoy it.

The film attempts to stare down social issues such as video game culture, anorexia, infidelity, fame hunting, and the proliferation of illicit material on the internet. As each character and each relationship is tested, we are shown the variety of roads people choose - some tragic, some hopeful - as it becomes clear that no one is immune to this enormous social change that has come through our phones, our tablets, and our computers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"People calling these legitimate feelings ""transphobia"" are just using labels of bigotry to shut up any dissenters, it's they way of forcing women into the closet, of shutting down conversation.  And it's highly ironic people not even thirty years ago told to go in the closet, are coming to act like the SAME bullies they fought against.   And it goes to show, that women really are the lowest class of citizen, because even someone as low on the hierarchal totem pole as M2T think they can bully and shit all over women. This proving all over again: women really ARE a class, one that IS in part defined by their biology.  M2T think they can bully us and threaten us with violence and we will cower BECAUSE they have a stronger male biology and they KNOW it. They KNOW they aren't real women, their entitled behavior and quickness to utilize violence and threats proves it...

leelem0n,"The problem is that they don't understand anorexia (or other eating disorders). They think that it's a problem you can ""catch"" through various habits, such as dieting or watching television shows with slim main characters. They don't understand that anorexia is a mental disorder that one is predisposed to having...meaning if you put two people in the same situation, they will react in different ways. The other issue is that they seem to think anorexia is a response to wanting to be thin, as opposed to having an irrational fear of weight gain and food to the point that a person puts himself or herself into a dangerous weight bracket. The anorexic person knows s/he does not look good and that's not what it's about for many. It's associated with OCD/anxiety in many sufferers and an inappropriate reaction to food and stresses.

hopelessneurotic,"At first, I hated every moment of it. I did it because I had to, but every moment of it I was planning my relapse. The whole recovery process was just a temporary measure to appease the doctors and family members pleading for me to make a change. I'd like to say that the symptoms of starvation (purple fingernails, constant feeling of cold, thoughts entirely dominated by food, fainting spells) went away with the beginning of refeed, but they really just got worse. Food made me bloated and hurt my stomach like hell. I was constantly nauseated, and felt disgusted with myself all of the time. But soon, my body began to react. After months of starvation, I suddenly felt a huge urge to eat. And eat. And eat. I was hungry constantly, and the hunger was completely consuming. Relapse was now impossible, my body needed to EAT. Emotionally, this was awful. I felt like I was binging, and that I was just going to gain weight infinitely. But as I continued through the recovery process, I started noticing other changes. My brain began to process things at a normal pace, I was less depressed. I actually wanted to go out and see people and do things. I had energy and enthusiasm for life. I still to this day get the occasional extreme hunger, but this has really gone down with a regular meal plan. Certain foods (my ""fear foods"") and situations (eating around family members and friends) still give me anxiety, but through therapy and support groups I'm learning coping mechanisms to overcome those feelings.

Triggers are not things you cower to and go cry on your keyboard while you wish you had the strength to have an eating disorder before remembering you had anorexia and binge eating disorder one day on the same day for twelve hours three years ago. Triggers are meant to be dealt with and you learn how to not let these things upset you anymore.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bluecanoe22,"This is my personal theory on why so many obese FA'ers claim to have ""restrictive"" diets and anorexia. Their weight is primarily caused by overeating - the loss of control over what they eat and how much they eat. Anorexia and ""restrictive"" eating are both associated with extreme control. They are able to restrain themselves (to a dangerous level) in regards to food. If these obese people have supposedly been anorexic, it means they've tried to control their portions, their calories, etc in the past and it ""didn't work."" If restricting their diet (supposedly) in the past did not work, then how could anyone tell them to try it again in the future? Thus, their bodies must ""just want to be"" a certain weight, it absolves them of all responsibility, and they can stuff their face as much as they want.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Technically you would have EDNOS but that regroups so many eating disorders with a certain weight criteria, not just anorexia. As a person who was anorexic without being underweight (i had a normal weight), i wasn't diagnosed with EDNOS. I was told i was borderline anorexic. You have no idea if that person was diagnosed or not. You say she's obese which you don't know for a fact, she says she didn't ""look anorexic"" not fat. If I had a penny for everytime an anorexic girl said she doesn't ""look anorexic"", I would be a billionnaire. They are all in denial about their appearance.

littlesoubrette,"So I actually have anorexia (in addition to SA). I have super anxiety about eating in front of others as well. Have you ever tried therapy? It's been very successful for me. The best advice I can give is to just keep practicing. Can you eat in public at all? If not, try just practicing eating alone at a restaurant or in your car or at a park or something like that. Once you can do that, try eating with the person you feel safest with somewhere out in public. Then increase that to your two closest friends. And so on until you feel comfortable in the group.

If you have the mental illness anorexia nervosa, which it sounds like could be an issue based on your need for control and your enjoyment from controlling your hunger, then you need a diagnosis and treatment. If it's a matter of you not feeling hungry, which is actually just plain anorexia, then that loss of appetite can itself be a clinical symptom of something more serious.

You should also know that while body dysmorphia is common in patients with anorexia nervosa, the primary driver of the disease is typically the need for control, and you don't have to have body dysmorphia to be anorexic. It's also common for people with eating disorders to have an obsession with food and cooking and then not eat it.

I thought that all was a distraction so I brought it back to Ash and I said that if he feels bad about himself, he could talk to a therapist or me about it, but that it is selfish and repugnant to involve Ash. He scoffed at the idea of the therapist and made several insulting comments on how therapists arenít ìreal doctorsî.

I saw that he was being bullheaded and I realized that he didnít care enough about my daughter to see his own behavior clearly. I told him that I would be getting a separation until he enters therapy, apologizes to Ash, and acknowledges his own issues. If he wouldnít do that, we would be getting a divorce.

"&gt;He basically told me that I would not be able to survive without his money and that he would take everything in a divorce. He was trying to intimidate me and use my lack of knowledge of legal matters. However, I knew this would not be true. I told him me and Ash would live in a cardboard box without him and be happy, rather than in a mansion with him and miserable, just to make a point. He brought up some of my own personal issues and some of our other marriage problems, but I knew it was over. I told him to get out of the house. He didnít want to leave, but I threatened to call the police. The house is in my name so he didnít have a legal leg to stand on. I suppose he is in a hotel right now.

I cannot believe how quickly this happened and how quickly it soured. But I knew, in my heart, that something like this would happen, as David is a very stubborn man. I told Ash and she was very upset, but I assured her itís not her fault. In any case, she has an appointment with the therapist on Friday, so hopefully that will be help.

"&gt;EDIT: Some of you are wondering why divorce was such a quick option for me. Our relationship has had some problems and isn't the strongest. He verbally abused me, and I considered divorce many times. We had actually discussed it and had many arguments before Ash was even 10. But I wanted Ash to be safe and happy in a two-parent home, and I wanted her to be around her friends and raised in a home with a steady income. He hadn't abused my daughter AT ALL before this happened. This was the push that led me to finally make a change.

It is possible that he never truly bonded with her but he hadn't abused her until this time.

"I've done therapy on/off since I was 10 so 16 years but I've never ever had therapy or inpatient that addresses my disorder. I was once stuck in a mental hospital for two weeks and their way of treating it was refusing to let me up from a table until I drank a shake can't remember it's name. Then as soon as I was above underweight I was sent home. I think it's really great your family has tried so hard to help her. But I can also see how frustrating it is/was when its never gotten better. Did she ever have a time where she did well? It's truly sad how little research has went into eating disorders and how to help people with them. It seems like such a taboo thing to even discuss anymore.  It's where schizophrenia was twenty years ago which is baffling considering anorexia has the highest suicide rate of any mental illness. They've discovered if you are a multiple you have a 33% more likely chance to develop it, I'm an identical twin and oddly my twin has had binge eating issues.

"It's hard to see the point when it seems like no matter what doc or therapist you see it's like you're speaking Chinese to them. I'm really shocked at how many have never even taken the time to read up on or get a basic understanding of eating disorders. Especially with celebs and mags pushing super skinny. I think if I can come out of this that's what I'd like to spend the rest of my life doing, helping others who suffer. And educating those who don't on them, you would not believe the amount of females who have begged for me to teach them anorexia. It really is something a lot of people see as just a really strict diet. It confuses me how people will accept depression, bi polar, schizophrenia , and so on as mental illnesses but eating disorders are just for attention whores who could quit anytime. I don't see how someone can't look at it and realize starving yourself isn't normal, being unable to eat because it feels like it would cripple you mentally isn't normal.

"Here's a link to a major European study that was published late last year. The authors found that ""evidence for addiction to specific macronutrients is lacking in humans"" and wrote the following material on sugar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"*In all aerobic cells, sugars are subjected to glycolysis to produce pyruvate ñ the fundamental substrate used to generate chemical energy in the citric acid cycle. As such, mono-, di- and polysaccharides are essential components of our diet. Animals have specialized senses that allow them to readily detect the presence of mono- and disaccharides in potential food sources, and humans perceive these substances as sweet. Rats also prefer sweet-tasting sugar solutions, and solutions of artificial sweeteners perceived as having equivalent sweetness, across a broad range of concentrations without prior training (Sclafani, 1987). Thus, there seems to be an innate (or a quickly learned) motivation to consume sweet foods.*",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"***Apart from a single case study (Thornley and McRobbie, 2009), addiction-related behaviors in sugar consumption (such as tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome) have not been observed in humans (Benton, 2010).*** *Instead, most observational and mechanistic evidence for addiction to sugar comes from rat models pioneered in Bart Hoebel's laboratory (Avena et al., 2008). A variety of subtly different approaches have been taken, but most studies involve examining feeding behavior during intermittent access to palatable sugar solutions. For example, repeated 12 h food deprivation followed by 12 h intermittent access to normal food and a sugar solution leads to sugar ìbingingî (defined operationally as an increased intake compared to rats offered unrestricted access over the same time period). Furthermore, there is evidence that endogenous opioid signaling is active during sugar (but not fat; Bocarsly et al., 2011) binging, as i.p. administration of the opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone, results in somatic effects reminiscent of a withdrawal syndrome (Colantuoni et al., 2002). It was suggested that sugar recruits endogenous opioid pathways, with consequences analogous to those that follow consumption of drugs of abuse. However, these data do not imply that these pathways are being activated by a substance. Certain behaviors can also recruit endogenous opioid systems. For example, rats subjected to food restriction and given 1hr/day access to a running wheel show a withdrawal syndrome on naloxone administration, whereas much weaker withdrawal-like behaviors were seen in food-restricted or pair-fed rats not given access to a running wheel ( Kanarek et al., 2009). The underlying endocrine mechanisms relevant in this model which has been used to explain the hyperactivity of patients with acute anorexia nervosa go well beyond the opioid system and include an activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis induced via hypoleptinemia ( Hebebrand et al., 2003); adrenalectomy ( Duclos et al., 2009) or exogenous application of leptin ( Exner et al., 2000) prevents the development of hyperactivity upon food restriction. This complex model indicates that the combination of an environmental effect (running wheel) with a specific temporal pattern of food restriction entails both a specific behavior (hyperactivity) and profound neuroendocrine alterations that include the engagement of the endogenous opioid system in a manner analogous to opiate drugs of abuse. Thus, under specific conditions addictive-like responses may be attributed not just to substances but also to behaviors. Alternatively, a behavior may become addictive because of the system(s) it activates. In the context of sugar addiction, a behavioral addiction rather than an addiction to a substance also warrants consideration as an explanation for the observations made in the respective experiments.*",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*Other models that evoke binging include a diet and stress model where cycles of food restriction and refeeding with palatable food are paired with acute stressors (Hagan et al., 2002). Given that this model explicitly uses a stressor and others use regular food deprivation (also a physiological stressor), these paradigms may represent a form of stress-evoked eating (Maniam and Morris, 2012). It is worth noting that in most of these sugar addiction models rats do not become obese. These rats down-regulate their energy intake from other sources and maintain a stable body weight (Avena et al., 2012), leading to the hypothesis that sugar addiction in humans ñ if it occurs at all ñ may not be relevant for the development of obesity. Since normal food intake is reduced after binges and weight gain does not occur, homeostatic mechanisms are preserved, it could be argued that these paradigms may better represent a form of binge-eating driven by intermittent access to hedonic stimuli.*",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*In humans, addictive behavior is often accompanied by complex psychological/psychiatric constructs like memory, boredom, shame, guilt, habit, impulsivity, restraint, depression and anxiety. Undoubtedly, these contribute to behavioral addiction but this further layer of complexity is difficult to model in rats (Packard, 2009). Based on a rat model for cocaine-craving behavior (Grimm et al., 2001), Grimm and co-workers showed that rats responded to a tone + light cue previously associated with 10% sucrose self-administration; lever pressing during tests for resistance to extinction and cue-induced reinstatement of sucrose seeking in rats progressively increased over the first 2 months of withdrawal (Grimm et al., 2002). Environmental enrichment such as grouping four animals in a large environment with novel objects has been shown to strongly attenuate cue-induced reinstatement of sucrose seeking (Grimm et al., 2008). The beneficial effect of an enriched environment on substance addiction in rodents has led Solinas and coworkers (2008) to suggest that in addition to cognitive and behavioral interventions to target craving-inducing situations, a positive and stimulating environment per se could facilitate abstinence.""*",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

soupastar,I actually had read that before and it broke my heart. I'm 26 had anorexia since I was ten it's an on/off thing like I may do great for a year then next year im awful. I had been doing kinda well for the past three years Ilafter having a bad relapse in 2008/09 then got better then three years ago i restricted like I might eat one day then not for 3 and so on. Then got to eating daily (mostly) but this past summer I spent over a month barely eating then restricted then stopped and ate kind of normal. But December I had issues then jan hit and all I've had so far is a few bites of lasagna and a small Salisbury steak in the first week of jan. I'm falling hard and fast. I've sought help but literally there are no treatment centers or even therapist near me the closest is 8 hours. I started back in therapy with a therapist who hasn't dealt with it but none around here have! She just seems to want me to go to inpatient and was like that's all I can do and im so ducking frustrated. I called/emailed every place in two states and found two who could help one is actually in a third state but said they don't know if they could make an exception and accept my insurance and that insurance would probably fight it. The other accepts it but I have to get underweight to be accepted. I'm just so fed up. And I have done three inpatients before I was 18 the one long term one I had the same insurance and the second I was a few pounds above under they tried every damn way to get me out and eventually succeeded. And the inpatient really wasn't focused on eating at all it was more depression suicide behavioral issues and so on out of almost 80 kids I was the only one with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I can't get my therapist to understand how hard it is to get into inpatient and stay for as long as you need. Have you read up on chronic anorexia? It's on scienceofeds I found it really informative and im begging my therapist to just try and help me maintain right now but all she wants is inpatient and says I don't think I can help you until ur inpatient. I'm so frustrated this is why I stopped therapy the last time. And I have a kid on top of that I have nobody who could watch him if I did go away until the summer. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" I was very overweight as of last summer: 6' 1"" 240 lbs... I didn't feel good at all about my self. SO I started a intense work out regiment and a strict diet. I grew stronger and stronger every day and by Christmas I was 190 lbs and in pretty good shape, I was addicting to the gym. By June I was 155 lbs of 9% body fat, I was everything I wanted to achieve. But it all started to go down hill. It started off with my parents getting a divorce, it made me not want to eat, drink, or socialize. As I loss my new Identity I fell into a deeper depression, every day I grew weaker and weaker and my brain grew a fog. Once I hit what I thought was bottom in less then a month I dropped 20 more lbs again and that's when the doctors found my tumor. They did not know what it was at first: If it was cancerous or dangerous but they knew they needed to take it out ASAP. This additional stress and soon to be lack of working out hindered my mind even more. This is where I went to the doctors again, weighing a whopping 120 pounds and was noting but skin and bones. About 3 weeks after that I went to the doctors after my surgery... When I went I was diagnosed with Anorexia, something in a million years I never thought would happen to me, or even guys for that matter. I guess deep down I knew I was suffering but I didn't want to say it. My doctor told me if I kept at my current pace, I would be dead in less then a year. I did not take her seriously, in 2 more weeks I needed to be admitted into a hospital. At this time I was 106 lbs being 6' 1"" I was weak and in absolute agony. After extensive therapy I got better and better. I am a a great weight now, a tad over weight but hey its better then being months away from death. I have a solid muscle build again now and out of my mental fog. Anorexia is just as much a physical sickness as a mental one, my mental wit diapered, my cognition, my humor, and being social was poison to me.

The ""cheat days"" that last for entire weekends, the ""drinks don't have calories"" frappachino dieters, and the mosey on the treadmill while eating french fries, they are almost as bad and often worse than the fats that just accept it since they are far more likely to claim genetics or anorexia being how people get thin after they inevitably fail a diet that they don't realize they never even started.",fatpeoplehate,t5_2x9xz,1,151,55.55,23.32,78.96,16.32,50.33,14.57,90.07,57.62,14.57,7.28,3.97,0,0,0,3.31,7.28,8.61,13.25,8.61,7.28,6.62,3.31,14.57,6.62,3.97,1.99,1.99,1.99,5.96,2.65,3.31,0,0.66,1.32,4.64,0,0,0,0,15.89,3.31,2.65,0.66,5.3,2.65,4.64,0.66,0.66,0,0,5.96,0.66,3.31,0,5.3,6.62,0,4.64,1.32,0.66,2.65,1.32,11.26,0,14.57,1.99,5.3,7.28,1.99,2.65,0,0,0,0,1.32,0,0.66,0,0.66,0,13.25,1.99,4.64,0,0,0,0,0,2.65,1.99,1.32,0.66

ahurlly,I was hospitalized with anorexia when I was in high school. I absolutely hate people who say they have anorexia just to make other people feel bad for them. They don't know what it's like to have your organs shut down and not care because dying seems like a better option than eating.
