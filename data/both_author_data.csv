24654918653efa65253028b1a8474c61,Well..when someone is obese its obvious when you look at them. We all know the health risks of obesity too. When someone is skinny you can't just label them with a mental disorder so easy its fucking stupid.,TumblrInAction,t5_2vizz,1
8b0d6fbd30e0beeab6189e26bdd67e45,"&gt;Clean eating means not overly processed, tons of added sugar, tons of added fat, microwave meals, etc. 

Maybe to you. There is no formal definition of ""clean eating"". It's a bogus term. What makes a food ""clean""? Is protein powder clean? Red meat? Sugar?

http://evidencemag.com/clean-eating/

&gt;Ironically, studies have shown that people who strictly avoid certain foods or food groups like bodybuilders, athletes, and people with eating disorders are often deficient in micronutrients.(34-40) As usual, balance and moderation are the most scientifically supported solutions.",Fitness,t5_2qhx4,7

c20b290a557c5c2494ee8181a174a82a,"Just because it's not a strong reaction doesn't mean the study is flawed, and if you had read the article, you'd know they also spoke of the benefits of red meat. It's a tradeoff, and a balance, like sunshine. We know that certain types of skin are more likely to develop cancers on extended exposure to the sun, but we also know that exposure to sunshine is important to health for most people.

As with almost everything, there are risks and benefits to be balanced. Forty thousand years ago didn't eat as much red meat, they didn't eat as much overall, and they had a lot more physical activity than we do now. They didn't live as long either, so long term health didn't matter as much. If they were somehow able to develop atherosclerosis, they would just have a heart attack and die, but by then they had already produced offspring.",science,t5_mouw,6

It is so easy ( and fun ) to make jokes about NK, their regime, the Kim's, the threats they make. This is likely intentional on their part. By seeming like a joke, making impotent threats, exaggerating claims all the time and making outrageous statements, they distract us from the true horror of what they are doing.

Me personally? I don't hit women. I roll with a girl that will beat the brakes off a bitch in a heartbeat for putting hands on me. If for some reason she was the female to be assaulting me I'd just bounce out because that's how I was raised. 

But best believe if you're a man half my size, my size, twice my size, it doesn't matter what size, and you come at me with them hands that I am not playing fuck around games with you. My goal immediately becomes to cause you as much physical pain as humanly possible so your immediate reaction is to stop attacking me and get the fuck away as fast as you can, or to beat you into unconsciousness so you no longer have the option to attack me. Don't want that to happen? Then don't play that shit. 

Because in today's day and age people get killed and that's a fact. So no I'm not gonna wait for the guy half my size to pull out a knife and gut me, because he's pissed and has the ability to do so still because I'm defending myself with half my ability because he's smaller than me. I'm going to attack him as hard as I can and hurt him as much as possible so he physically can't attack me anymore or mentally doesn't want to attack me anymore the moment he decides that's the choice he wants to make.

 [**Brutalist architecture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist%20architecture): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Brutalist architecture__ is a movement in architecture that flourished from the 1950s to the mid-1970s, descended from the [modernist architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_architecture) movement of the early 20th century. The term does not derive from the word ""brutal"", but originates from the French *béton brut*, or ""raw concrete"", a term used by [Le Corbusier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier) to describe his choice of material. [British architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_United_Kingdom) critic [Reyner Banham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reyner_Banham) adapted the term into ""brutalism"" (originally ""New Brutalism"") to identify the emerging style.

&gt;Brutalism became popular with governmental and institutional clients, with numerous examples in Britain, France, Germany, Japan, the United States, Canada, Brazil, the Philippines, and Australia. Examples are typically massive in character (even when not large), [fortress-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortification), with a predominance of exposed [concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete) construction, or in the case of the ""brick brutalists"" ruggedly detailed brickwork and concrete together. There is often an emphasis on graphically expressing in the external elevations and in the whole-site plan the main functions and people-flows of the buildings. Brutalism became popular for educational buildings (especially university buildings), but was relatively rare for corporate projects. Brutalism became favoured for many government projects, high-rise housing, and [shopping centres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_mall) to create an architectural image that communicated strength, functionality, and frank expression of materiality.

&gt;In its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy, Brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of some 1930s and 1940s architecture. In one critical appraisal by Banham, Brutalism was posited not as a style at all but as the expression of an atmosphere among architects of moral seriousness. ""Brutalism"" as an architectural critical term was not always consistently used by critics; architects themselves usually avoided using it altogether. More recently, ""brutalism"" has become used in popular discourse to refer to buildings of the late twentieth century that are large or unpopular – as a synonym for ""brutal"" – making its effective use in architectural historical discourse problematic.

 [**Welfare queen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare%20queen): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Welfare queen__ is a [pejorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative) phrase used in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America) to refer to people, usually women, who are accused of collecting excessive [welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_(financial_aid\)) payments through fraud or manipulation. Reporting on welfare fraud began during the early 1960s, appearing in general interest magazines such as *[Readers Digest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers_Digest)*. The term entered the American [lexicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon) during [Ronald Reagan's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan) [1976 presidential campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States\)_presidential_primaries,_1976) shortly after he described [a woman abusing welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Taylor) from [Chicago's South Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Side_(Chicago\)), but he never used the term ""welfare queen"" when referencing the woman.

&gt;A __pole of inaccessibility__ marks a location that is the most challenging to reach owing to its remoteness from [geographical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography) features that could provide access. Often it refers to the most distant point from the coastline. The term describes a geographic construct, not an actual physical phenomenon. Subject to varying definitions, it is of interest mostly to [explorers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explorer).

 [**Winged scapula**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged%20scapula): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;A __winged scapula__ (__scapula alata__) is a condition in which the shoulder blade, or shoulder bone, protrudes from a person’s back in an abnormal position. It is a rare condition with the potential to lead to limited functional activity in the upper extremity to which it is adjacent. It can affect a person’s ability to lift, pull, and push weighty objects. In some serious cases, the ability to perform [activities of daily living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living) such as changing one’s clothes and washing one’s hair may be hindered. The name of this condition comes from its appearance, a wing-like resemblance, due to the [medial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomical_terms#Anatomical_directions) border of the [scapula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_blade) sticking straight out from the back. Scapular winging has been observed to disrupt [scapulohumeral rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapulohumeral_muscles), contributing to decreased [flexion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion) and [abduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_(kinesiology\)) of the upper extremity, as well as a loss in power and the source of considerable pain.  A winged scapula is considered normal posture in young children, but not older children and adults.

&gt;___Metal: A Headbanger's Journey___ is a 2005 [documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film) directed by [Sam Dunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Dunn) with [Scot McFadyen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scot_McFadyen) and Jessica Wise. The film follows 31-year-old Dunn, a Canadian [anthropologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology), who has been a [heavy metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_(music\)) fan since the age of 12. Dunn sets out across the world to uncover the various opinions on heavy metal music, including its origins, culture, controversy, and the reasons it is loved by so many people. The film made its debut at the [2005 Toronto International Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Toronto_International_Film_Festival), and was released as a two-disc special edition DVD in the US on September 19, 2006.

There are many [cultivars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivar) of yam. Although some varieties of [sweet potato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_potato) (*Ipomoea batatas*) are also called *yam* in parts of the United States and Canada, it is not part of the family Dioscoreaceae but belongs in the unrelated [morning glory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_glory) family [Convolvulaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolvulaceae).

c71d5ac32c065a0fc6067aa601bb89a3,"Absolutely liquidate. Our bank's PB is not in the business of taking a hit/loss because we let a client blow through their margin. This is the response to the asset declining significantly in value, not necessarily the same thing as ""rates rising"".  There is also no guarantee a firm will pay its obligations on the debt (especially on jr unsecured or other lower priority tranches). In the event of catastrophic failure of a credit portfolio, the hedge fund can declare bankruptcy, wipe their hands clean, and owe us nothing beyond the liquidation value of the fund (and at 5x leverage, ""catastrophic"", where we could potentially incur a loss, would be a 20% hit in equity of the portfolio). Any deficit between that and the margin they posted would be our bank's loss.  Likewise, if they were to walk away from a negative margin equity portfolio, it could potentially take days (or weeks) to liquidate positions of a hedge funds size.  During this time, the liquidation could accelerate the market to move against the assets thus forcing greater losses on the bank.

This is why liquidity considerations are part of the margining methodology. In stocks we look at multiples of 100x avg daily trade volume. With credit we're concerned with % of outstanding issuance as well as # of available executable pricing sources (from appropriately sized dealers) and frequency of those broker quotes. 

This generalizes your question though. Credit portfolios don't inherently suffer when rates rise. There are plenty of floored and variable coupon and step coupon corp bonds out there that are intrinsically lower duration. ",investing,t5_2qhhq,3

This probably won't answer your question in regards to ""whats best"" but it really is a personal choice. It depends on what you plan on doing, what works for your budget, if you actually plan on moving it places etc. For example, you may want a more expensive Singer but ask yourself if you really plan on using *all* the stitches.  If meh, then go with something else. It's not really ""what's better"" but what you plan on actually using it for. Why bother spending extra cash if you aren't going to use all the settings?

de0fa3a83bea8aa34ce6a2df2cba9798,"Those look a lot like my first attempts too!

So, through trial and error I learned:

* Make sure your bottom coat is as dry as possible! You want to be able to smooth out any bubbles without having to worry about messing up your mani.   
* Make sure your tape is as unsticky as possible. It should be more like applying a window decal. I find shitty dollar store off-off brand tape is awesome for this. You can also apply the tape to your palm to pick up some oil and dirt and stuff to cut the stickiness. Don't worry! I won't transfer to your nails. 
* Try to keep your strokes going away from the edges of your tape. When you brush up against the tape, you could be squishing polish through any bubbles you might have missed. If you have a lot of lines, you can go parallel to them and it'll help.
* Plan your lines so you don't need too many coats to get it opaque. The polish that needs the most coats to be opaque should be your bottom coat whenever possible.
* Along with the tip above, don't let the polish dry for too long before taking the tape off. The drying polish will soften the polish beneath it and you might mess up your design. You should be taking the tape off once the polish is just getting sticky, but is still slightly liquid. It'll keep your it's shape and give you super clean lines. Too dry and you might get chipping. It depends on the formula though, so definitely experiment. 

These worked for me and the polishes I have. Different techniques work for different people. I have pretty low patience for day long manicures too and I usually slap on a coat of quick dry top coat as soon as I take my tape off and call it a day.

It could present a way to stop people from making absurd numbers of alt accounts and farming achievements, that was the issue with that event wasn't it?  If they played the event out just as before, but with a minimum Steam Level to trade the relevant items (low enough to be widely accessible, high enough that you have to have had Steam for at least a little while), I think it would nip those issues in the bud.

I don't mind the cards so much because it's essentially free money to me, I've saved quite a bit of extra dosh over the course of this sale, and appreciate a handful of change off most of the games I buy.  The gems on the other hand, I don't really see them as useful or exciting to anyone except those who have invested extremely heavily in Steam trading.  If you run the conversion rates it's almost always advantageous to sell your cards to Russian money launderers instead.

I hope they get around to doing something different with the sale items you get too.  As it is they're very lackluster, being essentially a sub-par Steam sale you can use off-season.

Many states do have specific laws revoking custody from rapists.  However I'm pretty sure those require a conviction.   Though frankly, as the law sits,  they're not a rapist if not found guilty.   

The problems with custody and child support involving ""rape"" where the offender is granted parental rights of support or custody,  isn't actual rape but statutory rape,  these cases are under a slightly different color of law,  as the offender and victim are not necessarily risk laden when it comes to the welfare of the child.  Even though if convicted they'd likely dissolve any parental rights anyhow.   Ultimately this particular matter isn't one of regular concern,  or even of minor concern.   At very worst,  the rape victim will have to fight the custody in court, which can be a pain in the ass,  plus a traumatic bit considering their rapist is the plaintiff.

So for example, if you are at the grocery store and you are not sure about a beer, you can scan the label and it will give you a score like 87.8% or 37.6%. which is just their guess at whether or not you will like it. I've played with it a little by scanning beers I know that I already know I like or dislike and and I think it does give make pretty damn good predictions once you've added enough reviews to your profile.

If you rate a beer/wine in their app, it won't tell you, ""If you liked this then you might like Beer X"" the way untappd does. It just stores that score data and uses it develop a profile for your likes and dislikes.




Their biggest shortcoming is that they actually have to have a sample of the beer/wine sent in for analysis to be able to rate it, so their database is lacking all but the more widely available and mainstream beers for the most part. It's still pretty new and growing though, and they claim to be constantly adding more and more to it.

f69baee154d5d773aedaa669d5b2af45,"Anything to do with fighting, fist or fire. 

A gun doesn't have a up and down recoil (anything with a stock) but rather a back and forth recoil. 

GUNS HAVE AMMO!!! everyone has a limited amount of ammo.

You can't out run gun fire. Like when you see the hero running and then you see a bunch of bullet hits behind him... Uh uh. It would simply take a small adjustment of the weapon in question to get your hits on target.

If the explosion is in any way felt by the person in question (considering it's some sort of frag) you'd be full of shrapnel or torn apart.

Real explosions are almost never fiery, unless gasoline or something was hit.

Tanks don't really get obliterated, but rather get pierced.

A gun shot wound makes it very hard to move and bleeds a good deal, but aren't 100% lethal. Look at the stats for ERs with GSWs (Gun shot wounds) that survive, or at least come in alive. They had to get shot, wait at least like a minute or more, and then get driven to the hospital. Now if you pop into a room with your service revolver and pop the three guys that are guarding the door in the torso, chances are they're not going to be dead right away, especially if they're wearing kevlar. They could hypothetically still try and draw a weapon or call for back up or scream.

Getting shot in a bullet proof vest does not mean you can get up and walk and continue fighting. You'd be down for the count at that point.

Getting punched in the face makes less sound than the sound of your clothes and shoes shuffling during the fight.

Getting punched in the face is not an instant knock out and more than often is simply the beginning of the fight. I've been punched in the face many times and have never once stumbled greatly, even if it was sudden. It's surprisingly hard to knock someone down with a punch to the face.

Getting kicked/punched in the legs and sides REALLY fucking hurts. You will often stumble or crumple down a little when you get hit there.

Getting a broken leg is pretty much impossible to walk **ON**.

Getting stabbed or cut hurts, but you can almost always keep fighting after getting one of these wounds.

Fist fights hurt your hands if they're not protected. You almost never see that part.

Martial arts are almost never effective.

PLEASE please please movie people, get your action scenes right, and for the love of god, show your actors how to use a gun. Hell take them to a shooting range and get them to play air soft of paintball or something. Just please, do something.

TLDR: by going 1 mph slower than I suaully drive 11 hours a day I lose $250 per month. 

We don't do it because we're trying to save fuel. It's to get ahead of the driver plain and simple. 
The typical argument I hear on Reddit is how we should just stay in the lane so people in cars don't get held up from us passing. 
First off, fuck anyone who says that. It's fucking selfish. 
If I'm going 65mph on flat ground and another driver is going 64mph I'm going to go around him because I want to keep going 65 and not 64 just because people driving a car can't wait a minute while I pass someone. 
If the guy I'm passing does 64mph 11 hours a day he will do 704 miles. If he does that 5 days a week for a whole year that's 183,000+ miles per year that he's doing. 
Now I come along doing 65mph. Which using the same math I cover 2,000 more miles a year than him. 

On a typical day with my current outfit I make about $250 per day doing about 350 miles. So since I'm covering 11 more miles than him a day but I get stuck behind him doing 64 that means I'm losing $250 per month. 
Now he doesn't directly cause this loss of income because he's just trucking along minding his own business. But I'm losing money by going slower because I get less loads done per year going slower than I usually go. 
So regardless if someone is approaching I'll swing around him, get back up to speed, pass him and then move back over. And then you can go by no problem. 
Additionally, I don't want to stare at the back of a trailer I know I can pass. Anyone can agree with that. 

If you made it this far then that's good. Haha

ebc9ab68e7f7df9125387511c3dae517,"I don't think it's rude per say. What this is intended to teach is in a situation where let's say a police officer pulls you over on your way to the park to meet up with your wife and kid to have lunch. 
He pulls you over for rolling a stop sign. You guys discuss it normally and he mentions that there is drug trafficking in your area and he would like to search your vehicle for drugs. Wells that's all good and great that he's doing his job but you do not have to show him shit without probable cause. A police officer has to have probable cause or a warrant to search your vehicle. You can deny him the ability to search your vehicle without a warrant. 

Let's turn the story. 
A friend calls you and asks for you to bring a cup of sugar with you to a party. You put it in a sandwich baggy and put it in the front seat. Same driving situation. 
He pulls you over. Sees the sugar that looks like an 8-ball and asks you to get out. At this point he has probable cause. Some people scream at them and ask to be released constantly. 
This picture doesn't say to do that. It's merely telling you what your rights are in certain situations and how they pertain to them. Of course every situation is different.

There are lots of barriers to exiting poverty, including lack of affordable housing and child care in urban areas, for example, and we should certainly focus on those.

I don't have a solution at hand to income inequality. Piketty proposes a wealth tax, which would have all sorts of unintended consequences, I suspect. Other sorts of tax on the wealthy (e.g. income surtaxes) generate very little revenue and thus are not of that much benefit.

As a counterpoint, though, *you're* extrapolating quite a bit. I don't sit down with the intent of deciding what the author is not being inclusive of, but I am acutely aware of things. Precisely because I'm *not* in a position to take it for granted, which is due to my own identifiers and variables.

Your assumptions aside--which is ironic when trying to call me out on extrapolation--my point is *not* that I should be catered to. My point is that gender is one of many things that *does* define who we are. And the further away from ""White, straight, cisgender, male"" you are, the more those identifiers define you. It's not about catering to people who aren't white, straight, cisgender or male, though. It's about the fact that

&gt;I write women as if they were men

Is poor advice. And to act like gender has no impression on who you are is foolish. Actually, I'm gonna cut the diplomacy: Acting like someone's gender doesn't matter is fucking bullshit and anyone who's interacted with other human beings should know better. For fucks sake, we wouldn't even be having this conversation if gender didn't matter.

And cut the ""you're just too much of an activist"" bullshit. I'm sorry, that's a terrible fucking argument to make in the first place, especially when it's not relevant here. I mean, again, you're making my point. People wouldn't have to be activists if this shit didn't matter, so *clearly it does*. Do you know what it's like to realize that people don't think you exist? To read a book and go ""hey, guess people like me can't be heroes"". Why the fuck do you think well written female fantasy characters are such a Big Deal in the first place? You wanna know what's tiring? Going to your escapism place and realizing that just like in the real world you're the butt of a joke. You think I like watching fucking *Men in Black III* and there's a throwaway joke where a runway model says ""hey"" with a deep voice? For fucks sake, try putting yourself in someone else's shoes. Imagine ""if I had to put up with this bullshit every single fucking day"" would I be so ready to brush it off?

That is, again, a digression, though, because my point, that you so clearly missed, is that gender has a fucking impact on who we are as people, because *it clearly matters to the world writ large*. If gender wasn't an important part of who we are, Robin Hobb wouldn't have wrote that post. If gender wasn't important to who we are, the post she read that made her want to write that wouldn't have existed.

Yes, in a vacuum, ""is gender important to who you are?"" wouldn't be a yes. But we don't live in a fucking vacuum. Vasquez from *Alien* was a part written for a man. It would also be a *completely different character* if it was played by a man. There would not be a fucking TVTrope [about the fact that strong female characters dying named after her](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VasquezAlwaysDies). And it pisses me off that this is a conversation that keeps coming up and people keep asking ""does this matter?"" Of course it fucking matters or it wouldn't keep coming up.

This isn't an activist thing. Among activist circles I'm considered a fucking troll. This is common fucking sense Jesus fucking Christ I would have expected one of the most respected female fantasy authors to realize that her gender is pretty fucking important to her story because her own story would be completely different if she was a man.",Fantasy,t5_2qknd,6
