      " gt I see repeatedly in tumblr posts from FAers that eating disorders will be solved once societies standards change about how women should look I don t believe so I don t suffer from anorexia or bulimia and I often try to understand those kinds of conditions and why it is that people have them I do however suffer from moderate to severe depression and anxiety And I see a lot of parallels While I can t exactly relate to an ED it s easy for me to understand a disproportionate lack of self worth To look back on whatever be it your weight your accomplishments your friends and family and still feel empty alone miserable and worthless To me it seems like ED s may have a similar thread where a person s ability to measure themselves objectively is impaired and causes self destructive behavior These days there is a lot of pressure on women to look a certain way less so than men Being a dude I never felt a massive amount of anxiety or guilt about my weight Instead I found other things to feel shit about And I did A lot And still do And I don t think it will ever go away So no I don t think that changing society s standards can fix a broken self image I believe though could be wrong that it is a fundamental deep rooted issue that goes beyond the specifics That being said not all women nor men will be supermodels There is truth to finding a way to live with yourself regardless of your weight As long as your weight isn t self destructive or harmful At r fatlogic we are completely against people doing harm to themselves and the delusions that come with that And it is absolute fact that being fat is harmful and self destructive As is having an ED that causes you to not be able to sustain your body s functions anymore Neither extreme is acceptable Fat people are not attractive because they don t care about themselves Emaciated people are not attractive because they don t care about themselves There is an objective middle ground Being healthy and confident gives you a leg up on almost any circumstance If your ED remains untreated you re doing yourself no more service than the FA s who delude their followers into maintaining a dangerous fat percentage You need to find the root of the issue and correct it But it may have nothing to do with supermodels or society it may have to do with something even deeper \n",

      "This I also have OCD and though I d always heard that eating disorders fell on the same spectrum it never really hit home for me until I saw a TV show about some women recovering from anorexia As part of their treatment they were asked to face some of the foods that made them the most anxious and then answer questions about what they were thinking and feeling When asked why eating those foods made them anxious they DIDN T say things like This cupcake will make me fat but rather things like I m afraid if I take one bite I won t be able to stop The more I read about people with ED the more I realize it s much more about control and other things than about weight If completely removed the societal pressures you might see a decrease in EDs BUT the underlying mental illness will probably only manifest itself in other ways \n",

      "Firstly EDs are extremely complicated mental illness s with many contributing factors This includes societal standards in regards to weight However every person s ED is different and it is definitely not a cause in every case as outlined by those who have already contributed Secondly ED s are more than just Anorexia and Bulimia The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM lists the full range of disorders which include EDNOS eating disorder not otherwise specified and BINGE EATING DISORDER Furthermore something that society at large overlooks is that if you looked at sufferers of the entire range of eating disorders most are of average or above average weight There are more bulimics than anorexics and bulimics are statistically more likely to be of average or above average weight similar with EDNOS Binge eating disorder involves a very high rate of obesity The underweight ED sufferer represents a much smaller proportion of EDs than most people assume I would also hypothesize that the rates of binge eating disorder would increase in a society with less social stigma against obesity in particular if the HAES movement became a societal norm \n",

      "http www wsj com articles paul mchugh transgender surgery isnt the solution Transgender Surgery Isn t the Solution A drastic physical change doesn t address underlying psycho social troubles Dr McHugh former psychiatrist in chief at Johns Hopkins Hospital is the author of Try to Remember Psychiatry s Clash Over Meaning Memory and Mind Dana Press The government and media alliance advancing the transgender cause has gone into overdrive in recent weeks On May a U S Department of Health and Human Services review board ruled that Medicare can pay for the reassignment surgery sought by the transgendered those who say that they don t identify with their biological sex Earlier last month Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said that he was open to lifting a ban on transgender individuals serving in the military Time magazine seeing the trend ran a cover story for its June issue called The Transgender Tipping Point America s next civil rights frontier Yet policy makers and the media are doing no favors either to the public or the transgendered by treating their confusions as a right in need of defending rather than as a mental disorder that deserves understanding treatment and prevention This intensely felt sense of being transgendered constitutes a mental disorder in two respects The first is that the idea of sex misalignment is simply mistaken it does not correspond with physical reality The second is that it can lead to grim psychological outcomes The transgendered suffer a disorder of assumption like those in other disorders familiar to psychiatrists With the transgendered the disordered assumption is that the individual differs from what seems given in nature namely one s maleness or femaleness Other kinds of disordered assumptions are held by those who suffer from anorexia and bulimia nervosa where the assumption that departs from physical reality is the belief by the dangerously thin that they are overweight With body dysmorphic disorder an often socially crippling condition the individual is consumed by the assumption I m ugly These disorders occur in subjects who have come to believe that some of their psycho social conflicts or problems will be resolved if they can change the way that they appear to others Such ideas work like ruling passions in their subjects minds and tend to be accompanied by a solipsistic argument For the transgendered this argument holds that one s feeling of gender is a conscious subjective sense that being in one s mind cannot be questioned by others The individual often seeks not just society s tolerance of this personal truth but affirmation of it Here rests the support for transgender equality the demands for government payment for medical and surgical treatments and for access to all sex based public roles and privileges With this argument advocates for the transgendered have persuaded several states including California New Jersey and Massachusetts to pass laws barring psychiatrists even with parental permission from striving to restore natural gender feelings to a transgender minor That government can intrude into parents rights to seek help in guiding their children indicates how powerful these advocates have become How to respond Psychiatrists obviously must challenge the solipsistic concept that what is in the mind cannot be questioned Disorders of consciousness after all represent psychiatry s domain declaring them off limits would eliminate the field Many will recall how in the s an accusation of parental sex abuse of children was deemed unquestionable by the solipsists of the recovered memory craze You won t hear it from those championing transgender equality but controlled and follow up studies reveal fundamental problems with this movement When children who reported transgender feelings were tracked without medical or surgical treatment at both Vanderbilt University and London s Portman Clinic of them spontaneously lost those feelings Some did have persisting feelings what differentiates those individuals remains to be discerned We at Johns Hopkins University which in the s was the first American medical center to venture into sex reassignment surgery launched a study in the s comparing the outcomes of transgendered people who had the surgery with the outcomes of those who did not Most of the surgically treated patients described themselves as satisfied by the results but their subsequent psycho social adjustments were no better than those who didn t have the surgery And so at Hopkins we stopped doing sex reassignment surgery since producing a satisfied but still troubled patient seemed an inadequate reason for surgically amputating normal organs It now appears that our long ago decision was a wise one A study at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden produced the most illuminating results yet regarding the transgendered evidence that should give advocates pause The long term study up to years followed people who had sex reassignment surgery The study revealed that beginning about years after having the surgery the transgendered began to experience increasing mental difficulties Most shockingly their suicide mortality rose almost fold above the comparable nontransgender population This disturbing result has as yet no explanation but probably reflects the growing sense of isolation reported by the aging transgendered after surgery The high suicide rate certainly challenges the surgery prescription There are subgroups of the transgendered and for none does reassignment seem apt One group includes male prisoners like Pvt Bradley Manning the convicted national security leaker who now wishes to be called Chelsea Facing long sentences and the rigors of a men s prison they have an obvious motive for wanting to change their sex and hence their prison Given that they committed their crimes as males they should be punished as such after serving their time they will be free to reconsider their gender Another subgroup consists of young men and women susceptible to suggestion from everything is normal sex education amplified by Internet chat groups These are the transgender subjects most like anorexia nervosa patients They become persuaded that seeking a drastic physical change will banish their psycho social problems Diversity counselors in their schools rather like cult leaders may encourage these young people to distance themselves from their families and offer advice on rebutting arguments against having transgender surgery Treatments here must begin with removing the young person from the suggestive environment and offering a counter message in family therapy Then there is the subgroup of very young often prepubescent children who notice distinct sex roles in the culture and exploring how they fit in begin imitating the opposite sex Misguided doctors at medical centers including Boston s Children s Hospital have begun trying to treat this behavior by administering puberty delaying hormones to render later sex change surgeries less onerous even though the drugs stunt the children s growth and risk causing sterility Given that close to of such children would abandon their confusion and grow naturally into adult life if untreated these medical interventions come close to child abuse A better way to help these children with devoted parenting At the heart of the problem is confusion over the nature of the transgendered Sex change is biologically impossible People who undergo sex reassignment surgery do not change from men to women or vice versa Rather they become feminized men or masculinized women Claiming that this is civil rights matter and encouraging surgical intervention is in reality to collaborate with and promote a mental disorder Dr McHugh former psychiatrist in chief at Johns Hopkins Hospital is the author of Try to Remember Psychiatry s Clash Over Meaning Memory and Mind Dana Press \n",
