He or she can help you plan a strategy including medical and psychological (therapy) help for your daughter, and couples or family therapy for the two of you.  This is very serious business. People die from eating disorders. Between organ failure and suicide, Anorexia Nervosa is the most lethal of all mental illnesses. I have been involved with the eating disorder community for years, between my own recovery and my daughter's, and I know people who've died both ways. I know of even more suicide attempts. Last thing this world needs again is another light put out by this terrible illness.\n",
